}

When they go off, they spray seven
hundred 1.2 millimeter steel pellets
in a 60 degree pattern much like an

{
Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of
the best sniper rifles in the world.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly
through a 2.5 centimeter square from
a distance of 100 meters.
}

}
|.....................................|

possible.
}
|.....................................|
{
You found Stinger missiles. Great!
}
|.....................................|
{
They are equipped with a thermal
homing device, so once they locked
on they will automatically pursue
the target.
}
|.....................................|
{
To lock on, all you have to do is line
up the crosshairs.
}
|.....................................|
{
Stingers are very potent, short-range,
low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the
Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of
Soviet aircraft with them.
}
|.....................................|
{
In fact, they were forced to change
their tactics.
}
|.....................................|
{
One of my favorite horror books is
called Stinger and my favorite cocktail
is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've
got a thing for Stingers.
}
|.....................................|
{
Good.
You found a Suppressor for the
SOCOM pistol.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you equip that, you won't have to
worry about being noticed by the
enemy when you fire.
}
|.....................................|
{
It will greatly reduce the sound and
flash from your muzzle.
}
|.....................................|
{
It uses a multi-layered chamber to
lower the velocity of the gas emissions
and thus reduce the sound and flash
when you fire your weapon.
}
|.....................................|
{
The Suppressor is narrow enough so
that you can still use the gun's original
sight even when it is equipped.
}
|.....................................|
{
It shouldn't change the feel when you
fire it.
}
|.....................................|
{
That is a Mine Detector. It works by
searching for metal objects.
It will even find Claymores that are
hidden with optic stealth technology.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is set so that the position of the land
mines will show up on your radar.
}
|.....................................|
{
All you have to do is equip the mine
detector and keep an eye on your
radar. Use it carefully.
}
|.....................................|
{
Nuclear weapons, nuclear
reactors, hazardous waste...
}
|.....................................|
{
We're constantly being exposed to
plutonium and other radioactive
materials. Compared to that, smoking
seems not so bad, no?
}
|.....................................|
{
A cardboard box.
}
|.....................................|
{
A cardboard box usually consists of a
thin pasteboard with a corrugated
paper center. They are usually made
of recycled paper.
}
|.....................................|
{
It was first invented in Europe over a
hundred years ago.
It was originally used to absorb one's
sweat when wearing hats.
}
|.....................................|
{
With the same amount of wood to
make one wooden box, you can make
six or seven cardboard boxes.
}
|.....................................|
{
And since it's recyclable, it's highly
economical. In addition, It is strong
and easy to store. That's why it's
widely used for packing.
}
|.....................................|
{
But to avoid damaging weapons and
other delicate instruments when
shipping them, they should be
packed in stronger boxes, like...

}
|.....................................|
{
wood or something.
}
|.....................................|
{
Also, the crevices should be filled with
Styrofoam to prevent them from
moving around.
}
|.....................................|
{
...So anyway, what's with the box?
}
|.....................................|
{
...Oh nothing...no big deal.
}
|.....................................|
{
You got a Gas Mask. Good.
}
|.....................................|
{
That is a double eye-piece type. Be
careful. Unlike the transparent shield
type, it will restrict your field of vision.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is equipped with a voice emitter,
so do not worry about not being 
heard.
}
|.....................................|
{
The outside is made of reinforced 
plastic and the inside is made from 
an acetate weave.

}
|.....................................|
{
Also the eye pieces are specially 
treated so they won't fog up.

}
|.....................................|
{
You will be able to stay in a gas-filled
area for a long time with that mask.
Use it wisely.
}
|.....................................|
{
A tranquilizer? Yes.
}
|.....................................|
{
I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to
prevent her hands from quivering.
}
|.....................................|
{
Maybe you should try the same thing.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those are Night-Vision Goggles.
They do not use special lenses.
}
|.....................................|
{
They electronically amplify the light by
transforming it into electric signals
which they then boost to create an
image.
}
|.....................................|
{
They amplify the light 100,000 times.
You will be able to see 500 meters by
starlight just as if it was day.
}
|.....................................|
{
But it won't work in complete
darkness since there is no light to
amplify.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those Night-Vision Goggles will make
your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use
them for too long a period of time.
}
|.....................................|
{
Thermal Goggles work by thermal
imaging instead of by amplifying light
like the Night-Vision Goggles.
}
|.....................................|
{
They'll work just as well in complete
darkness. Not only that, they can also
penetrate optic stealth systems.
}
|.....................................|
{
You will be able to spot Claymores too.
}
|.....................................|
{
But they will tire your eyes out,
so do not use them too much.
}
|.....................................|
{
Cold medicine?
I don't know. It looks like regular old
cold medicine to me.
}
|.....................................|
{
Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters
thick, lightweight and hard to cut you
should be able to rappel with it as
well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
}
|.....................................|
{
No. It looks like it's made of
nylon fibers.
}
|.....................................|
{
Good. When hemp rope gets wet it
loses its flexibility. It would not be
good for rappelling. But that rope
sounds like it will not be a problem.
}
|.....................................|
{
You found Body Armor. It will lower the
damage you take from gunfire.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is designed to prevent bullets
from penetrating, but you will still
feel the impact from the bullets.
Don't rely on it too much.
}
|.....................................|
{
The nuclear weapons disposal facility
on Shadow Moses Island was built at
the beginning of this century.
}
|.....................................|
{
It was made only to temporarily store
the nuclear warheads.
}
|.....................................|
{
Why? If they wanted to dispose of
them, why wouldn't they just dismantle 
them right away?
}
|.....................................|
{
They cannot do that. You see, when
you dismantle a warhead, you still
have nuclear materials that must be
stored.
}
|.....................................|
{
At this point, all of the nuclear
material storage facilities are
way past capacity.
}
|.....................................|
{
But they could not stop dismantling
weapons while at the same time
pushing START-2...
}
|.....................................|
{
So you're telling me that this base was
built so they could temporarily avoid
being in conflict with START-2?
}
|.....................................|
{
Most people think that we live in a
safer world now. But with all the
dismantled nuclear weapons and
waste around,
}
|.....................................|
{
...the threat of nuclear terrorism has
increased tremendously.
}
|.....................................|
{
It's ironic, isn't it?
}
|.....................................|
{
After the START-2 accord
was signed on January 3,
1993...
}
|.....................................|
{
Russia and the U.S. reduced their
strategic nuclear warheads to
between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads
each.
}
|.....................................|
{
They completely dismantled all of the
ICBMs which contained MIRVs
(multiple independently targeted
reentry vehicles).
}
|.....................................|
{
As a result of that, there are over
15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads
waiting to be disposed of.
}
|.....................................|
{
The warheads are supposed
to be dismantled at Pantex or
some other dismantling facility,
}
|.....................................|
{
but there are limits to how
many warheads they can process.
}
|.....................................|
{
We just do not have the
capabilities to dismantle all
the warheads that are out
there.
}
|.....................................|
{
Over 200 tons of plutonium and over
1,000 tons of high grade uranium have
been removed from nuclear weapons
so far.
}
|.....................................|
{
And on top of that, nuclear reactors all
over the world continue to produce
and leak spent nuclear fuel.
}
|.....................................|
{
According to one estimate, as of the
year 2005, America alone was storing
over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.
}
|.....................................|
{
There is no room left in our nuclear
material storage sites. That is why we
need nuclear weapon disposal
facilities.
}

{
This is Nastasha Romanenko.
A pleasure to work with you,
Solid Snake.
}
|.....................................|
{
You're the nuclear specialist that the
Colonel mentioned?
}
|.....................................|
{
You're the nuclear specialist that the
Colonel mentioned?
}
|.....................................|
{
That's me.
You can ask me anything about nukes
that you want.
}
|.....................................|
{
I am also a military analyst, so I have
an extensive knowledge of weapon
systems as well.
}
|.....................................|
{
They asked me to participate in this
operation as a supervisor from the
Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
I was happy to accept.
}
|.....................................|
{
We must not allow terrorists to get
their hands on nuclear weapons of any
kind. I hope I can help you to stop
them.
}
|.....................................|
{
You're a tough lady.
}
|.....................................|
{
You're a tough lady.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those terrorists are serious about
launching a nuclear weapon?
}
|.....................................|
{
The world cannot stand by idly and
allow that to happen.
And neither can I...
}
|.....................................|
{
Unfortunately, all I can do from here is
provide you with information...
}
|.....................................|
{
Hopefully that'll be enough. Another
soldier here wouldn't make a
difference anyway. It's good to work
with you, Nastasha.
}
|.....................................|
{
Hopefully that'll be enough. Another
soldier here wouldn't make a
difference anyway. It's good to work
with you, Nastasha.
}
|.....................................|
{
Same here, Snake.
}
|.....................................|
{
As long as the strategy of nuclear
deterrence continues, nuclear
weapons may be reduced, but
they will never be eliminated.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you think about it, nuclear reduction
does not mean much without
elimination as the ultimate goal.
}
|.....................................|
{
I used to work in the DIA (Defense
Intelligence Agency). I figured the
only way to achieve nuclear
elimination...
}
|.....................................|
{
...was to work from the inside to
convince them of the ineffectiveness
of the deterrence theory.
}
|.....................................|
{
Seems like you're pretty focused on
that issue.
}
|.....................................|
{
...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad
thing to see...and I have seen a lot of
it.
}
|.....................................|
{
...I have seen more than enough of it...
}
|.....................................|
{
?
}
|.....................................|
{
I was born and raised in Prypiat,
Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that
day...April 26, 1986.
}
|.....................................|
{
You don't mean...
}
|.....................................|
{
Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that
changed my life and thousands of
other lives. I lived just three
kilometers north of there.
}
|.....................................|
{
..........
}
|.....................................|
{
600,000-700,000 people were
evacuated. Over 650,000 children
suffered the effects of radiation
poisoning.
}
|.....................................|
{
Between 1986 and 1993,
12,000 children died...
}
|.....................................|
{
My parents, and many others like
them who helped in the cleanup,
died a few years later from radiation
sickness.
}
|.....................................|
{
We must rid this world of all nuclear
weapons...before they cause more
misery.
}
|.....................................|
{
Before they destroy the delicate
environment that keeps us alive.
}
|.....................................|
{
I will not allow this pain and anxiety to
pass on to yet another generation.
}
|.....................................|
{
The area is filled with gas. Probably
an organophosphate nerve agent like
Soman or something similar.
}
|.....................................|
{
Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you
some protection. Also, your
nanomachines contain anti-BC
neutralizing agents, so...
}
|.....................................|
{
...you should be okay for a short
time. But what you really need is 
a Gas Mask.
}
|.....................................|
{
An organophosphate nerve agent is a
gas which invades an animal's nerves.
}
|.....................................|
{
It was first used as a weapon in World
War II, and the casualties resulting
from it were tremendous.
}
|.....................................|
{
In its pure form, it is a colorless,
odorless gas. That gas was probably
colored yellow to make it easier to
detect in the case of a leak.
}
|.....................................|
{
It sounds like you have a bad cold.
You had better try to shake it off.
}
|.....................................|
{
Harasho...good!
You found a SOCOM. That's a Special
Operations Command Pistol.
}
|.....................................|
{
It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of
stopping power.
It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser
Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you hold down the Weapon Button,
you can train the laser sight on the
enemy to help you aim.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you find a SOCOM suppressor,
you can equip that, too.
}
|.....................................|
{
That pistol was designed specifically
for use by special forces, so I think it
will be useful.
}
|.....................................|
{
Some people find it a little heavy and
hard to use, but it shouldn't be
a problem for you.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those are Stun Grenades.
They are often used in sensitive
operations such as freeing hostages
and that sort of thing.
}
|.....................................|
{
Sometimes they are called {80}{22}flash
bangs{80}{22} or  {80}{22}sound and flash
grenades.{80}{22}
}
|.....................................|
{
They make a big flash and lots of
noise which will disorient and disable
your opponents temporarily.
}
|.....................................|
{
You have to understand that they
won't kill the bad guys, but just stun
them for a few seconds.
Use them wisely.
}
|.....................................|
{
That's a Chaff Grenade.
It's a special grenade that disperses
thin, narrow metallic strips of various
lengths and frequency responses.
}
|.....................................|
{
It can confuse electronic equipment.
}
|.....................................|
{
It will be useful against machines
which depend upon electronic
sensors.
}
|.....................................|
{
Naturally, for it to be effective, you
must use it before you are attacked.
If you are expecting an attack, spread
the chaff beforehand.
}
|.....................................|
{
You found some Grenades. Just pull
the pin and it explodes after five
seconds.
}
|.....................................|
{
You can get a lot done during those
five seconds, Snake.
How you use them is up to you.

}
|.....................................|
{
That is C4 explosive.
A plastic explosive with a texture
similar to clay, so you can shape it
in almost any way you want.
}
|.....................................|
{
Although it has 1.4 times the
destructive power of dynamite,
}
|.....................................|
{
it is highly stable and won't explode
without a detonating device, even if it
is shot, burned or beaten.
}
|.....................................|
{
You are using a wireless
detonator, yes?
}
|.....................................|
{
The detonator is equipped with a
scrambler so you don't have to worry
about interference from any other
radio source.
}
|.....................................|
{
Make sure you are sufficiently far
enough away when it goes off.
}
|.....................................|
{
Also, as you know, the sound of the
explosive will alert your enemies, 
so be careful.
}
|.....................................|
{
That is a FAMAS.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is a bullpup style assault rifle. 
It is durable and easy to use. Very
resistant to overheating, it is a reliable
weapon with smooth action.
}
|.....................................|
{
It can fire up to 1,000 rounds per
minute. On full auto, you will empty a 
25 round magazine in a few seconds.

a new type.
}
|.....................................|

reconaissance missiles, sometimes
called Nikita Missiles.
}
|.....................................|
{
They've got CCD cameras in
their nose cones.
}
|.....................................|
{
After you fire them, they'll transmit
their visual data to your monitor.
You can control their flight freely in all
directions.
}

of fuel. Watch the gauge carefully.

{
With the same amount of wood to
make one wooden box, you can make
six or seven cardboard boxes.
}
|.....................................|
{
And since it's recyclable, it's highly
economical. In addition, It is strong
and easy to store. That's why it's
widely used for packing.
}
|.....................................|
{
But to avoid damaging weapons and
other delicate instruments when
shipping them, they should be
packed in stronger boxes, like...

}
|.....................................|
{
wood or something.
}
|.....................................|
{
Also, the crevices should be filled with
Styrofoam to prevent them from
moving around.
}
|.....................................|
{
...So anyway, what's with the box?
}
|.....................................|
{
...Oh nothing...no big deal.
}
|.....................................|
{
You got a Gas Mask. Good.
}
|.....................................|
{
That is a double eye-piece type. Be
careful. Unlike the transparent shield
type, it will restrict your field of vision.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is equipped with a voice emitter,
so do not worry about not being 
heard.
}
|.....................................|
{
The outside is made of reinforced 
plastic and the inside is made from 
an acetate weave.

}
|.....................................|
{
Also the eye pieces are specially 
treated so they won't fog up.

}
|.....................................|
{
You will be able to stay in a gas-filled
area for a long time with that mask.
Use it wisely.
}
|.....................................|
{
A tranquilizer? Yes.
}
|.....................................|
{
I heard that Sniper Wolf uses them to
prevent her hands from quivering.
}
|.....................................|
{
Maybe you should try the same thing.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those are Night-Vision Goggles.
They do not use special lenses.
}
|.....................................|
{
They electronically amplify the light by
transforming it into electric signals
which they then boost to create an
image.
}
|.....................................|
{
They amplify the light 100,000 times.
You will be able to see 500 meters by
starlight just as if it was day.
}
|.....................................|
{
But it won't work in complete
darkness since there is no light to
amplify.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those Night-Vision Goggles will make
your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use
them for too long a period of time.
}
|.....................................|
{
Thermal Goggles work by thermal
imaging instead of by amplifying light
like the Night-Vision Goggles.
}
|.....................................|
{
They'll work just as well in complete
darkness. Not only that, they can also
penetrate optic stealth systems.
}
|.....................................|
{
You will be able to spot Claymores too.
}
|.....................................|
{
But they will tire your eyes out,
so do not use them too much.
}
|.....................................|
{
Cold medicine?
I don't know. It looks like regular old
cold medicine to me.
}
|.....................................|
{
Rope? If it is at least 12 millimeters
thick, lightweight and hard to cut you
should be able to rappel with it as
well. It is not a hemp rope is it?
}
|.....................................|
{
No. It looks like it's made of
nylon fibers.
}
|.....................................|
{
Good. When hemp rope gets wet it
loses its flexibility. It would not be
good for rappelling. But that rope
sounds like it will not be a problem.
}
|.....................................|
{
You found Body Armor. It will lower the
damage you take from gunfire.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is designed to prevent bullets
from penetrating, but you will still
feel the impact from the bullets.
Don't rely on it too much.
}
|.....................................|
{
They were conducting exercises with
this new Metal Gear prototype? Is that
what the DARPA Chief said?
}
|.....................................|
{
Yeah.
}
|.....................................|
{
What the hell...!?
}
|.....................................|
{
So you know about Metal Gear?
}
|.....................................|
{
Just rumors. I heard it is some kind of
walking tank that can deliver an
accurate nuclear strike from any
terrain...mountains, deserts, swamps...
}
|.....................................|
{
...wherever. But you are the real
expert on Metal Gear, aren't you
Snake?
}
|.....................................|
{
Yeah, I guess I am. But what about
the PAL system that the DARPA Chief 
mentioned?
}
|.....................................|
{
It is a device attached to a nuclear
weapon system to prevent the missile
from being armed or launched.
}
|.....................................|
{
Usually a secret detonation code or
combination is necessary to launch
the missile.
}
|.....................................|
{
According to the chief, there are two
codes and the terrorists already know
one of them.
}
|.....................................|
{
The other code...if the terrorists find
out that one too...
}
|.....................................|
{
Yeah... I've got to hurry and rescue
President Baker...
}
|.....................................|
{
PAL stands for {80}{22}Permissive Action
Link.{80}{22} It is a safety system attached
to nuclear missile systems.
}
|.....................................|
{
The missile cannot be fired without
the insertion of a special electronic
code.
}
|.....................................|
{
But if the terrorists have found out the
detonation codes, they can launch the
missile anytime they want.
}
|.....................................|
{
Is it possible to destroy the PAL
system so that the missile can be fired
even without inserting the detonation
code?
}
|.....................................|
{
I do not believe so.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is set up so that the warhead will
become automatically inactive if any
attempt is made to remove,
deactivate or destroy the PAL.
}
|.....................................|
{
So unless the terrorists either learn
the detonation codes or get their
hands on the detonation code
override keys,
}
|.....................................|
{
...there's no way they can launch...
}
|.....................................|
{
Do not be too sure. Any system can
contain bugs or malfunctions.
We cannot relax yet.
}
|.....................................|
{
I do not know much about Metal Gear.
Just the little I have heard.
}
|.....................................|

I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in
1995 and then again in Zanzibar
in 1999...
}
|.....................................|

Both were Third World countries led
by military regimes.
}
|.....................................|

They secretly developed Metal Gear

power throughout the world.

hero...you, Solid Snake.

}

That was a long time ago....
}
|.....................................|
{
All the ICBM silos are closely
monitored by military satellites.
}
|.....................................|
{
SLBM-equipped submarines can
move secretly, but naturally they are
limited to launching from the water.
}
|.....................................|
{
Finally, there are ALBMs which can
be launched from aircraft. They allow
for excellent mobility, but they are
somewhat unreliable...
}
|.....................................|
{
Metal Gear was developed to solve
all those problems.
}
|.....................................|
{
It can move freely over any terrain and
independently launch a nuclear
missile at any target in the world.
}
|.....................................|
{
It completely changes the nature of
the strategic arms race and destroys
the delicate nuclear balance...It's 
a weapon to be feared, believe me.
}
|.....................................|

The development of Metal Gear is a
cynical attempt to consolidate and
increase our military dominance...
}

the pretense of disarming ourselves.
}

{
Now that the SLCM zero option,
allowing for the sneak inspections of
submarines in international waters,
has been concluded,
}
|.....................................|
{
...the value of submarines as strategic
weapons has been greatly diminished.
}
|.....................................|

With Metal Gear, governments of the
world will be able to avoid this type of

The nuclear weapons disposal facility
on Shadow Moses Island was built at
the beginning of this century.
}
|.....................................|
{
It was made only to temporarily store
the nuclear warheads.
}
|.....................................|
{
Why? If they wanted to dispose of
them, why wouldn't they just dismantle 
them right away?
}
|.....................................|
{
They cannot do that. You see, when
you dismantle a warhead, you still
have nuclear materials that must be
stored.
}
|.....................................|
{
At this point, all of the nuclear
material storage facilities are
way past capacity.
}
|.....................................|
{
But they could not stop dismantling
weapons while at the same time
pushing START-2...
}
|.....................................|
{
So you're telling me that this base was
built so they could temporarily avoid
being in conflict with START-2?
}
|.....................................|
{
Most people think that we live in a
safer world now. But with all the
dismantled nuclear weapons and
waste around,
}
|.....................................|
{
...the threat of nuclear terrorism has
increased tremendously.
}
|.....................................|
{
It's ironic, isn't it?
}
|.....................................|
{
After the START-2 accord
was signed on January 3,
1993...
}
|.....................................|
{
Russia and the U.S. reduced their
strategic nuclear warheads to
between 3,000 and 3,500 warheads
each.
}
|.....................................|
{
They completely dismantled all of the
ICBMs which contained MIRVs
(multiple independently targeted
reentry vehicles).
}
|.....................................|
{
As a result of that, there are over
15,000 dismantled nuclear warheads
waiting to be disposed of.
}
|.....................................|
{
The warheads are supposed
to be dismantled at Pantex or
some other dismantling facility,
}
|.....................................|
{
but there are limits to how
many warheads they can process.
}
|.....................................|
{
We just do not have the
capabilities to dismantle all
the warheads that are out
there.
}
|.....................................|
{
Over 200 tons of plutonium and over
1,000 tons of high grade uranium have
been removed from nuclear weapons
so far.
}
|.....................................|
{
And on top of that, nuclear reactors all
over the world continue to produce
and leak spent nuclear fuel.
}
|.....................................|
{
According to one estimate, as of the
year 2005, America alone was storing
over 50,000 tons of nuclear material.

With Metal Gear, governments of the
world will be able to avoid this type of
inspection,
}
|.....................................|
{
...and at the same time stay in
compliance with international
nuclear treaties.
}
|.....................................|
{
PAL stands for {80}{22}Permissive Action
Link.{80}{22} It is a safety system attached
to nuclear missile systems.
}
|.....................................|
{
The missile cannot be fired without
the insertion of a special electronic
code.
}
|.....................................|
{
But if the terrorists have found out the
detonation codes, they can launch the
missile anytime they want.
}
|.....................................|
{
Is it possible to destroy the PAL
system so that the missile can be fired
even without inserting the detonation
code?
}
|.....................................|
{
I do not believe so.
}
|.....................................|
{
It is set up so that the warhead will
become automatically inactive if any
attempt is made to remove,
deactivate or destroy the PAL.
}
|.....................................|
{
So unless the terrorists either learn
the detonation codes or get their
hands on the detonation code
override keys,
}
|.....................................|
{
...there's no way they can launch...
}
|.....................................|
{
Do not be too sure. Any system can
contain bugs or malfunctions.
We cannot relax yet.
}
|.....................................|
{
I do not know much about Metal Gear.
Just the little I have heard.
}
|.....................................|
{
I know it appeared in Outer Heaven in
1995 and then again in Zanzibar
in 1999...
}
|.....................................|
{
Both were Third World countries led
by military regimes.
}
|.....................................|
{
They secretly developed Metal Gear
to increase their military and political
power throughout the world.
}
|.....................................|
{
But both were stopped by a lone
hero...you, Solid Snake.
}
|.....................................|
{
..........
}
|.....................................|
{
That was a long time ago....
}
|.....................................|
{
All the ICBM silos are closely
monitored by military satellites.
}
|.....................................|
{
SLBM-equipped submarines can
move secretly, but naturally they are
limited to launching from the water.
}
|.....................................|
{
Finally, there are ALBMs which can
be launched from aircraft. They allow
for excellent mobility, but they are
somewhat unreliable...
}
|.....................................|
{
Metal Gear was developed to solve
all those problems.
}
|.....................................|
{
It can move freely over any terrain and
independently launch a nuclear
missile at any target in the world.
}
|.....................................|
{
It completely changes the nature of
the strategic arms race and destroys
the delicate nuclear balance...It's 
a weapon to be feared, believe me.
}
|.....................................|
{
The development of Metal Gear is a
cynical attempt to consolidate and
increase our military dominance...
}
|.....................................|
{
...while at the same time maintaining
the pretense of disarming ourselves.
}
|.....................................|
{
Now that the SLCM zero option,
allowing for the sneak inspections of
submarines in international waters,
has been concluded,
}
|.....................................|
{
...the value of submarines as strategic
weapons has been greatly diminished.
}
|.....................................|
{
With Metal Gear, governments of the
world will be able to avoid this type of
inspection,
}
|.....................................|
{
...and at the same time stay in
compliance with international
nuclear treaties.
}
|.....................................|
{
This is Nastasha Romanenko.
A pleasure to work with you,
Solid Snake.
}
|.....................................|
{
You're the nuclear specialist that the
Colonel mentioned?
}
|.....................................|
{
You're the nuclear specialist that the
Colonel mentioned?
}
|.....................................|
{
That's me.
You can ask me anything about nukes
that you want.
}
|.....................................|
{
I am also a military analyst, so I have
an extensive knowledge of weapon
systems as well.
}
|.....................................|
{
They asked me to participate in this
operation as a supervisor from the
Nuclear Emergency Search Team.
I was happy to accept.
}
|.....................................|
{
We must not allow terrorists to get
their hands on nuclear weapons of any
kind. I hope I can help you to stop
them.
}
|.....................................|
{
You're a tough lady.
}
|.....................................|
{
You're a tough lady.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those terrorists are serious about
launching a nuclear weapon?
}
|.....................................|
{
The world cannot stand by idly and
allow that to happen.
And neither can I...
}
|.....................................|
{
Unfortunately, all I can do from here is
provide you with information...
}
|.....................................|
{
Hopefully that'll be enough. Another
soldier here wouldn't make a
difference anyway. It's good to work
with you, Nastasha.
}
|.....................................|
{
Hopefully that'll be enough. Another
soldier here wouldn't make a
difference anyway. It's good to work
with you, Nastasha.
}
|.....................................|
{
Same here, Snake.
}
|.....................................|
{
That M1 tank is equipped with
advanced vetronics.
Once it locks on to a target, it
automatically tracks it,
}
|.....................................|
{
and its main gun is effective up to
3000 meters.
}
|.....................................|
{
To get close, you'll have to confuse
its tracking system. Use your Chaff.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you can jam the system and get
close enough, it won't be able to use
its main gun.
}
|.....................................|
{
Use your Chaff at a long distance to
fool its electronic systems.
}
|.....................................|
{
Even if you can get close, the M1
tank's maximum speed is 45 miles per
hour. First, you'll have to slow it down.
}
|.....................................|
{
Go after its caterpillars with C4 or
Grenades.
}
|.....................................|
{
Once it slows down, toss a Grenade in
the commander's turret.
}
|.....................................|
{
The M1 has exceptionally strong
armor.
}
|.....................................|
{
With your weapons, the only way to
beat it is to attack the soldiers inside
through the hatch.
}
|.....................................|
{
Try to aim at the upper hatch with your
grenades.
}
|.....................................|
{
Use your Chaff at a long distance to
fool its electronic systems.
}
|.....................................|
{
Try to aim at the upper hatch with your
grenades.
}
|.....................................|
{
Look at him move!
...He must have some kind of powered
exoskeleton.
}
|.....................................|
{
Powered exoskeleton? You mean like
prosthetic arms and legs?
}
|.....................................|
{
No. Prosthetics are intended to
replace original body parts. That
ninja's exoskeleton makes him far
stronger than any normal human.
}
|.....................................|
{
He is a true cyborg...
a cybernetic organism.
}
|.....................................|
{
So he's half machine, huh...?
}
|.....................................|
{
I heard rumors about the experiments,
but I had no idea that such a creature
really existed...
}
|.....................................|
{
Snake, to save Dr. Emmerich, you must
defeat that ninja. Don't give up.
}
|.....................................|
{
As long as the strategy of nuclear
deterrence continues, nuclear
weapons may be reduced, but
they will never be eliminated.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you think about it, nuclear reduction
does not mean much without
elimination as the ultimate goal.
}
|.....................................|
{
I used to work in the DIA (Defense
Intelligence Agency). I figured the
only way to achieve nuclear
elimination...
}
|.....................................|
{
...was to work from the inside to
convince them of the ineffectiveness
of the deterrence theory.
}
|.....................................|
{
Seems like you're pretty focused on
that issue.
}
|.....................................|
{
...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad
thing to see...and I have seen a lot of
it.
}
|.....................................|
{
...I have seen more than enough of it...
}
|.....................................|
{
?
}
|.....................................|
{
I was born and raised in Prypiat,
Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that
day...April 26, 1986.
}
|.....................................|
{
You don't mean...
}
|.....................................|
{
Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that
changed my life and thousands of
other lives. I lived just three
kilometers north of there.
}
|.....................................|
{
..........
}
|.....................................|
{
600,000-700,000 people were
evacuated. Over 650,000 children
suffered the effects of radiation
poisoning.
}
|.....................................|
{
Between 1986 and 1993,
12,000 children died...
}
|.....................................|
{
My parents, and many others like
them who helped in the cleanup,
died a few years later from radiation
sickness.
}
|.....................................|
{
We must rid this world of all nuclear
weapons...before they cause more
misery.
}
|.....................................|
{
Before they destroy the delicate
environment that keeps us alive.
}
|.....................................|
{
I will not allow this pain and anxiety to
pass on to yet another generation.
}
|.....................................|
{
The area is filled with gas. Probably
an organophosphate nerve agent like
Soman or something similar.
}
|.....................................|
{
Well, your Sneaking Suit gives you
some protection. Also, your
nanomachines contain anti-BC
neutralizing agents, so...
}
|.....................................|
{
...you should be okay for a short
time. But what you really need is 
a Gas Mask.
}
|.....................................|
{
An organophosphate nerve agent is a
gas which invades an animal's nerves.
}
|.....................................|
{
It was first used as a weapon in World
War II, and the casualties resulting
from it were tremendous.
}
|.....................................|
{
In its pure form, it is a colorless,
odorless gas. That gas was probably
colored yellow to make it easier to
detect in the case of a leak.
}
|.....................................|
{
It sounds like you have a bad cold.
You had better try to shake it off.
}
|.....................................|
{
Harasho...good!
You found a SOCOM. That's a Special
Operations Command Pistol.
}
|.....................................|
{
It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of
stopping power.
It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser
Aiming Module) for night-time combat.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you hold down the Weapon Button,
you can train the laser sight on the
enemy to help you aim.
}
|.....................................|
{
If you find a SOCOM suppressor,
you can equip that, too.
}
|.....................................|
{
That pistol was designed specifically
for use by special forces, so I think it
will be useful.
}
|.....................................|
{
Some people find it a little heavy and
hard to use, but it shouldn't be
a problem for you.
}
|.....................................|
{
Those are Stun Grenades.
They are often used in sensitive
operations such as freeing hostages
and that sort of thing.
}
|.....................................|
{
Sometimes they are called {80}{22}flash
bangs{80}{22} or  {80}{22}sound and flash
grenades.{80}{22}
}
|.....................................|
{
They make a big flash and lots of
noise which will disorient and disable
your opponents temporarily.
}
|.....................................|
{
You have to understand that they
won't kill the bad guys, but just stun
them for a few seconds.
Use them wisely.
}
|.....................................|
{
That's a Chaff Grenade.
It's a special grenade that disperses
thin, narrow metallic strips of various
lengths and frequency responses.
}
|.....................................|
{
It can confuse electronic equipment.
}
|.....................................|
{
It will be useful against machines
which depend upon electronic
sensors.
}
|.....................................|
{
Naturally, for it to be effective, you
must use it before you are attacked.
If you are expecting an attack, spread
the chaff beforehand.
}
|.....................................|
{
You found some Grenades. Just pull
the pin and it explodes after five
seconds.
}
|.....................................|
{
You can get a lot done during those
five seconds, Snake.
How you use them is up to you.

}
|.....................................|
{
That is C4 explosive.
A plastic explosive with a texture
similar to clay, so you can shape it
in almost any way you want.
}
|.....................................|
{
Although it has 1.4 times the
destructive power of dynamite,
}
|.....................................|
{
it is highly stable and won't explode
without a detonating device, even if it
is shot, burned or beaten.
}
|.....................................|
{
You are using a wireless
detonator, yes?
}
|.....................................|
{
The detonator is equipped with a
scrambler so you don't have to worry
about interference from any other
radio source.
}
