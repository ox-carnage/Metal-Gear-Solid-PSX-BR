[f295][c339][0000]

called here for the test launching of[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][3bf7][0400]
Why FOX-HOUND?[00][01ff]
[f295][c339][0000]
Because they're a Special Ops group[80][23][80][4e]
used to handling top secret missions.[00][01ff]
[f295][c339][0000]
They figured they could help keep it[80][23][80][4e]

But we must have fired nuclear[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Why just this time?[00][01ff]
[f295][c339][0000]
I heard it was because this was to be[80][23][80][4e]
a final test before the formal adoption[80][23][80][4e]
of the Metal Gear program...that's[80][23][80][4e]

I think they're forcing him to work on[80][23][80][4e]
the nuclear launching program.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So they'll need him alive until that's[80][23][80][4e]
done anyway...[00][01ff]

You're right.[00][01ff]

Ever since I was a little girl, I always[80][23][80][4e]
dreamed about being a soldier...[00][01ff]
[f295][c20c][0000]
Everyday of my life, I've trained my[80][23][80][4e]
mind and body for the one day when[80][23][80][4e]
I could finally see some real action,[80][23][80][4e]
and now...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So what now? You wanna quit?[00][01ff]
[f295][c20c][0000]
I can't quit.[00][03ff]

Listen, Meryl. Everybody feels sick[80][23][80][4e]
the first time they kill someone.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Unfortunately, killing is one of those[80][23][80][4e]
things that gets easier the more you[80][23][80][4e]
do it.[00][01ff]

In a war, all of mankind's worst[80][23][80][4e]

It's easy to forget what a sin is in[80][23][80][4e]

[f295][c339][0000]
But this isn't a war.[00][01ff]

It's a terrorist action.[00][01ff]

You're just a little jumpy from the[80][23][80][4e]

starting to thin out.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Just take it easy.[00][01ff]
[f295][f964][0000]
But I learned all about combat high at[80][23][80][4e]

careful and avoid getting into a fight[80][23][80][4e]
whenever you can.[00][01ff]

will always have enough.[80][22][00][01ff]

our desire is got without content.[80][22][00][01ff]

know what that means?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]

Sim. It's a great system. Not only can[80][23][80][4e]
I read the topography, but I can[80][23][80][4e]
monitor the movement of the bad guys[80][23][80][4e]
too.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Pretty convenient, huh. It also makes it[80][23][80][4e]

In my parents' homeland they say [80][22]If[80][23][80][4e]
there are more wolves, the people are[80][23][80][4e]
eaten; If there are more people, the[80][23][80][4e]
wolves are eaten.[80][22][00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
That means the side with greater[80][23][80][4e]

That would be nice. I'm starting to[80][23][80][4e]

Ransacking rooms, rifling through[80][23][80][4e]

But you have no choice, Snake.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Maybe so, but I think I'm starting to[80][23][80][4e]
develop kleptomania. I just keep [80][23][80][4e]
putting things in my pocket.[00][0000]

Mei Ling, how did you get into this[80][23][80][4e]
line of work?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
The truth is...I always wanted to[80][23][80][4e]
become a fighter pilot.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
I fell in love with jets watching them in[80][23][80][4e]
the movies.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You'd be surprised how many people[80][23][80][4e]
say the same thing.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
But I didn't want to kill people. That's[80][23][80][4e]
when I heard that the US Air Force[80][23][80][4e]
needed people to do BDAs, battle[80][23][80][4e]
damage assessments.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Those are the guys whose job it is to[80][23][80][4e]
confirm how successful a bombing run[80][23][80][4e]
was.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Sim. So I started to do research into[80][23][80][4e]
aerial photography and air[80][23][80][4e]
intelligence. I made it my major.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
But there are no pilots who only do[80][23][80][4e]
BDAs...[00][01ff]
[8ad7][33ce][0800]
That's right. But by the time I learned[80][23][80][4e]
that, I was already an expert in my[80][23][80][4e]
field.[00][0000]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Mei Ling, you said that you wanted[80][23][80][4e]
to become a pilot. Did you take[80][23][80][4e]
an aptitude test?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Well, I've got bad eyes. You probably[80][23][80][4e]
didn't know it, but I'm wearing contact[80][23][80][4e]
lenses.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So you failed your aptitude test, huh?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Yeah, it's ridiculous. We're not flying[80][23][80][4e]
around in biplanes anymore, y'know.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
That's right. Today's pilots fly jets that[80][23][80][4e]
go several times the speed of sound.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Exactly. At those speeds, the naked[80][23][80][4e]
eye isn't that useful. You need[80][23][80][4e]
sophisticated electronics to see[80][23][80][4e]
what's really going on.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So is that why you developed your[80][23][80][4e]
radar system?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Sim. I wanted to develop a radar[80][23][80][4e]
system that would help soldiers make[80][23][80][4e]
better, more informed decisions.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So your radar shows what's really[80][23][80][4e]
going on, huh?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
It depends on how you interpret it.[80][23][80][4e]
Like beauty, truth is in the eye of[80][23][80][4e]
the beholder.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You can say that again.[00][0000]

[8ad7][4753][0000]
Snake, what does it feel like to fight?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Why do you ask?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
I like to play fighting games.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Games?[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Sim. Fighting games. Since I started[80][23][80][4e]
this job, I've seen so many people kill[80][23][80][4e]
each other. But I always see it on[80][23][80][4e]
a monitor, or in burst transmission.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Not a very good job, huh.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
I'm not sure. When you watch it on[80][23][80][4e]
a monitor, it starts to feel just like[80][23][80][4e]
a video game.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
This is no game! There are no[80][23][80][4e]
startovers if you make a mistake.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
I'm sorry...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Killing's not fun. It's not pretty either,[80][23][80][4e]
like it looks in those video games.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
Okay, Snake...I understand. [80][23][80][4e]
War's not a game.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Listen, Mei Ling, after this operation is[80][23][80][4e]
over, I want you to go back to being[80][23][80][4e]
a normal student.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You should be having fun...playing real[80][23][80][4e]
video games instead of playing war.[00][0000]

knowing itself, strikes swiftly.[80][22][00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
It means that if you have confidence[80][23][80][4e]
that what you are doing is part of your[80][23][80][4e]
true nature, there should be no[80][23][80][4e]
hesitation.[00][01ff]
[8ad7][4753][0000]
I don't know whether your orders are[80][23][80][4e]
in your true nature or not. But Snake...[80][23][80][4e]
believe in yourself![00][0000]

I think it's true. Once you're dead,[80][23][80][4e]

Absolutely not. Snake, you've got to[80][23][80][4e]

[8865][2033][0000]
This op is security level Red.[00][01ff]

hallucination.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
Is it from the nanomachines?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
No, Snake.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
The nanomachines are functioning[80][23][80][4e]
properly.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
So what was it?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
It must have been psychometric[80][23][80][4e]
interference coming from Psycho[80][23][80][4e]
Mantis, FOX-HOUND's psychic.[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0300]
Think of it is a mental feedback loop.[00][01ff]

[ca21][23ae][0400]
Some kind of poison!?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
Well, there are lots of drugs that can[80][23][80][4e]
cause a heart attack in large doses.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
For example potassium chloride or[80][23][80][4e]
dioxides...[90][01]But...[00][01ff]

From what I could tell, he didn't know[80][23][80][4e]
who he was.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Are you saying that he's just[80][23][80][4e]
a mindless robot?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I'm not sure, but he seems intent on[80][23][80][4e]
fighting me to the death...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...we'll meet again, I know it.[00][06ff]

[ca21][3bf7][0400]
I'd rather not, but maybe that's what[80][23][80][4e]

[7594][f321][0000]
For Campbell's sake?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]

[8865][565e][0000]
Sniper's trick to lure you out.[00][01ff]
[8865][565e][0000]
The sniper's waiting for you to go[80][23][80][4e]

off...Don't do it![00][06ff]

FOX-HOUND's best shooter.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Snipers usually work in pairs, [80][23][80][4e]
but this one's alone, huh?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
I know her.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
She can wait for hours, days or weeks.[80][23][80][4e]
It doesn't matter to her.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
She's just watching and waiting for[80][23][80][4e]
you to expose yourself.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0800]
Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out[80][23][80][4e]
that long...[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
Snake, can you see Wolf from where[80][23][80][4e]
you are?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0600]
There's nowhere to hide between[80][23][80][4e]
here and the tower...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...she must be on the 2nd floor of[80][23][80][4e]
the tower.[00][06ff]

If Wolf is in the Communications[80][23][80][4e]
Tower, she can see you perfectly! [80][23][80][4e]
It's the classic sniper's position!![00][01ff]
[8865][565e][0000]
At that distance you won't be able to[80][23][80][4e]
hit her with a standard weapon either![00][01ff]

the President had not been briefed[80][23][80][4e]
about the Rex Project.[00][01ff]

[80][22]Need to know basis[80][22], is that[80][23][80][4e]
the idea?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
These are sensitive times. Even sub-[80][23][80][4e]

[8865][2033][0000]
Yes.[00][01ff]

And tomorrow, the President and his[80][23][80][4e]

We still haven't even ratified Start 2[80][23][80][4e]

reputation and America's place as[80][23][80][4e]
the dominant superpower.[00][01ff]

code?[00][01ff]

launch.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]

[ca21][7e0b][0000]
It seems there's some type of[80][23][80][4e]
emergency override device that[80][23][80][4e]
can cancel out the detonation[80][23][80][4e]
code.[00][01ff]

It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech[80][23][80][4e]
installed secretly.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0000]
You have to unlock it with three[80][23][80][4e]
special card keys.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
And where are those keys?[00][01ff]

[ca21][7e0b][0000]
Sort of an unwritten rule...[00][01ff]

I wanted to figure out why I'm the way[80][23][80][4e]
I am.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0000]
So you studied about DNA?[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
Yeah. I thought if I studied my genetic[80][23][80][4e]
structure, I'd find out who I really was.[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
I thought that by analyzing a person's[80][23][80][4e]
genetic information,[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
I could retrieve the blank spots in that[80][23][80][4e]
person's memory.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0000]
Memory is stored in DNA?[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0800]
We're not sure.[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
But we know that a person's[80][23][80][4e]
genetic fate is determined just[80][23][80][4e]

She was a soldier. She knew the risks.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Battlefield casualties are always[80][23][80][4e]

Is he an informer?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Maybe some kind of renegade?[00][01ff]

Snake, you can have regrets if you[80][23][80][4e]
want to...it's only natural.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
But you can't keep attacking yourself[80][23][80][4e]
for things that happened in the past.[00][01ff]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
What?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
There were five stealth camouflage[80][23][80][4e]
prototypes in my lab.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah, so?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
If you take out the one I'm wearing,[80][23][80][4e]
that leaves four.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Hey. This isn't first grade math class.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
I thought I'd get one for you, [80][23][80][4e]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It's really strange.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It was like someone was intentionally[80][23][80][4e]
holding it.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
When you were riding on it, did[80][23][80][4e]
the weight limit warning go off?[00][01ff]

That's another thing that bothered me[80][23][80][4e]

The warning went off and I know[80][23][80][4e]
I couldn't be over the limit.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
How much do you weigh?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
About 135.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
But that elevator had a weight limit of[80][23][80][4e]
650 pounds.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0300]
It would take at least five people to[80][23][80][4e]

What's up?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
I was in the FBI too, y'know.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I didn't know that. What's your point?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Dr. Hunter's story about her[80][23][80][4e]
background...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
...about her grandfather being[80][23][80][4e]
an assistant secretary to Hoover in[80][23][80][4e]
the FBI...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
And then going undercover to[80][23][80][4e]
investigate the mafia in New York..[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah, what about it?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
It was all a big lie.[00][03ff]

[ca21][3bf7][0400]
What did you say?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
It was really bothering me.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Why would she lie about it?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
She lied?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
She might be a spy![00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0400]
Ridiculous.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
C'mon. Even a high school student[80][23][80][4e]
could see past it.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
The head of the FBI at that time,[80][23][80][4e]
Edgar Hoover...he was a well-known[80][23][80][4e]
racist.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Didn't Naomi say that her father was[80][23][80][4e]
Japanese?[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
Yeah...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Well back then there wasn't a single[80][23][80][4e]
Asian investigator.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Also, in the 1950's the undercover[80][23][80][4e]
mafia sting operations hadn't even[80][23][80][4e]
started yet.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
They first started in 1960...in Chicago,[80][23][80][4e]
not New York.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
But...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
You better check it out.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
The chief and the president[80][23][80][4e]
mysteriously dying, that ninja...too[80][23][80][4e]
many strange things are happening.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
Are you saying that Naomi might be[80][23][80][4e]
behind it?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
I don't know.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Either that or she's working with the[80][23][80][4e]
terrorists.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
...Could it be?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
If I find out anything, I'll call.[00][01ff]

hear this too.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah...go on Master.[00][01ff]

The real Naomi Hunter disappeared[80][23][80][4e]

Metal Gear ready.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
How do you know that?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
I overheard them talking.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Where are you now?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Right in front of Metal Gear.[80][23][80][4e]
...but it's strange.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
What is?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
There's nobody here...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...no guards, nobody patrolling...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...it's too quiet.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Maybe because they're all ready.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
They said they even input[80][23][80][4e]
the PAL codes.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
What should I do?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
All we can do is use the override[80][23][80][4e]
system that President Baker told[80][23][80][4e]
you about.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
But I've only got one of the three keys.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
And besides that, like Ocelot said,[80][23][80][4e]
there's some trick to using the keys...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][4a28][0800]
Leave it to me...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You got some kind of plan?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0800]
Well, I'm in the computer[80][23][80][4e]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]
I'm trying to access Baker's private[80][23][80][4e]

Baker's files?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Don't you need a password?[00][01ff]

I accessed the confidential[80][23][80][4e]
Metal Gear file.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0400]
So what about the PAL override[80][23][80][4e]

Bloco: 000544a8 Size: 0037
000544a8;00063639
[2c3d][5dad][0400]
The secret behind the new nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapon![00][03ff]

Bloco: 000544e9 Size: 01cb
000544e9;0006367a
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Just as I thought, the nuclear warhead[80][23][80][4e]
is designed to be fired from the rail[80][23][80][4e]
gun like a projectile...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It doesn't use fuel, so it isn't[80][23][80][4e]
considered a missile.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That way it can get around all sorts of[80][23][80][4e]
international treaties.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0800]
Pretty sneaky.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yes, but effective.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And that's not even the scariest thing[80][23][80][4e]
about this weapon.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I can't wait to hear this.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][709c][0800]
It's a stealth weapon![00][03ff]

Bloco: 000546be Size: 0424
000546be;0006384f
[ca21][3bf7][0400]
You mean it won't show up on radar?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0600]
Yeah.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The truth is...they've been working on[80][23][80][4e]
a stealth missile since the late 70's.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Why weren't they able to develop one[80][23][80][4e]
up until now?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Because of the missile's rocket[80][23][80][4e]
propulsion system...it will be[80][23][80][4e]
picked up by enemy satellites.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Oh yeah, that makes sense.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
But unlike a missile, the rail gun[80][23][80][4e]
doesn't burn any propellent.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
So it can't be detected by any current[80][23][80][4e]
ballistic missile detection systems.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
An invisible nuclear warhead...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Totally impossible to intercept.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And on top of that it's got a surface[80][23][80][4e]
piercing warhead designed to[80][23][80][4e]
penetrate hardened underground[80][23][80][4e]
bases.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
We learned that lesson in[80][23][80][4e]
the Gulf War.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][709c][0600]
This thing could mean the end of[80][23][80][4e]
the world![00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
It's the ultimate weapon.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
And from a political point of view,[80][23][80][4e]
it avoids the problem of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
reduction and nuclear inspections.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0400]

it could delay the signing of the Start 3[80][23][80][4e]
Treaty and cause a huge international[80][23][80][4e]
incident.[00][06ff]

Yeah, it would be nasty.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The United States would be[80][23][80][4e]
denounced by the U.N...it could[80][23][80][4e]
even bring the President down...[00][01ff]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Snake, listen to me.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
This new nuclear weapon...it's never[80][23][80][4e]
actually been tested, only simulated.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
You mean they ran a computer model?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yeah, that's why they were conducting[80][23][80][4e]
this exercise.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
They needed to get actual[80][23][80][4e]
experimental data to back[80][23][80][4e]
up the simulation.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
What were the results of the exercise?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It looks like it went better than they[80][23][80][4e]
hoped for. But...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
I can't find the data anywhere on[80][23][80][4e]
this network.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
You'd think that data as important as[80][23][80][4e]
that would be carefully recorded...[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
It was. President Baker gave me an[80][23][80][4e]
optical disk with all of the test data.[00][06ff]

[2c3d][5dad][0400]
The terrorists have replaced the[80][23][80][4e]
dummy warhead with a real warhead.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0400]
Once they input the detonation[80][23][80][4e]
codes, they should be ready to launch.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
So you think they can do it?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Well, the dummy warhead was[80][23][80][4e]
designed to be identical to the real[80][23][80][4e]
thing, so I think so.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
Did you find out how to override it yet?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0400]
Not yet.[80][23][80][4e]
It must be in a separate file.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Right now I'm looking through all of[80][23][80][4e]
Baker's personal files.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
We're counting on you...[00][0000]

Snake?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Did you find it?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
No, I haven't found out about[80][23][80][4e]
the override system yet, but[80][23][80][4e]
I found Baker's ulterior motive.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
He's just looking to get rich, isn't he?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That's part of it. ArmsTech is in much[80][23][80][4e]
worse financial trouble than I thought.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I know they lost their bid to make the[80][23][80][4e]
next generation fighter jet. That plus[80][23][80][4e]
the reduction in SDI spending...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It looks like there was even some talk[80][23][80][4e]
of a hostile takeover.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Everything was riding on this project,[80][23][80][4e]
I guess.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And it looks like we were paying a lot[80][23][80][4e]
of bribe money to the DARPA Chief.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Bribe money, huh.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yeah, and Baker was a big proponent[80][23][80][4e]
of the nuclear deterrent theory.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I see...[80][23][80][4e]
So anyway, what about the override?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Just give me a little bit longer...[00][ff00]

Bloco: 0005572a Size: 049c

[2c3d][4a28][0800]
Snake, I found Baker's top-secret[80][23][80][4e]
files![00][01ff]
[ca21][2872][0800]
Great job.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0800]
How's it going there?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0800]
They've finished inputting[80][23][80][4e]
the PAL codes.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So how do we deactivate them?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Okay...y'see the override system that[80][23][80][4e]
the president was talking about...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It can also be used to input[80][23][80][4e]
the detonation codes.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Y'see, if you insert the keys when the[80][23][80][4e]
warhead is active, you deactivate it.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And if you insert them when it's[80][23][80][4e]
inactive, it becomes activated.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And you can only use the keys once.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Only once, huh.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yeah...you'd better get started.[80][23][80][4e]
We don't have much time.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
But it takes three keys, right!?[80][23][80][4e]
I've only got one of them![00][01ff]
[2c3d][4a28][0800]
Hold on a minute.[80][23][80][4e]
Y'see that's the trick.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][4a28][0000]
You already have all three keys![00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0400]
What are you talking about!?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0400]
The card key is made of a shape[80][23][80][4e]
memory alloy.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0600]
Shape memory alloy?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yes. It's a material that changes shape[80][23][80][4e]
at different temperatures.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The key is made out of it![00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
This card key?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yeah.[80][23][80][4e]
The card key changes shape at[80][23][80][4e]
different temperatures.[00][06ff]

Bloco: 00055bd0 Size: 0041

[226c][c09c][0000]
Snake. It's about Naomi Hunter...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Then you should talk to the Colonel.[80][23][80][4e]
He's looking into it.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Turn your monitor off.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Okay it's off. No one else can hear us.[80][23][80][4e]
Go ahead.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Sorry, but I didn't want the Colonel to[80][23][80][4e]
hear.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Okay, so what's up?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
I've got a good friend in[80][23][80][4e]
the Pentagon...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
He's the one who told me about it...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
It looks like the DIA recently[80][23][80][4e]
developed a new type of[80][23][80][4e]
assassination weapon.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
An assassination weapon?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Snake, have you ever heard of[80][23][80][4e]
something called [80][22]FoxDie[80][22]?[00][01ff]

...Liquid and the others were[80][23][80][4e]
talking about it...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Yeah. It's some kind of virus that[80][23][80][4e]
targets specific people.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
I don't know all the details, but...[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
What are you trying to say?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
It's too similar.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0400]
What is!?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
The cause of death. Didn't the[80][23][80][4e]
ArmsTech president and the DARPA[80][23][80][4e]
Chief, I mean Decoy Octopus,...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
...die of something that looked like a[80][23][80][4e]
heart attack?[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
Yeah...?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Well, apparently FoxDie kills its[80][23][80][4e]
victims by simulating a heart attack.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
..........[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
...No...You're telling me that Naomi was[80][23][80][4e]
behind it?[00][01ff]

give you some kind of injection?[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0800]
...The nanomachines.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
She was in the best position to have[80][23][80][4e]
done it, but I don't know what her[80][23][80][4e]
motive was.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
...Does the Colonel know?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
I'm not sure. But he still hasn't[80][23][80][4e]
questioned her.[00][01ff]

She was sending coded messages[80][23][80][4e]
towards the Alaskan base.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
I didn't want to believe it, but she[80][23][80][4e]

What kind of interrogation?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]

You killed my benefactor and sent[80][23][80][4e]
my brother home a cripple.[00][01ff]

I vowed revenge and joined[80][23][80][4e]
FOX-HOUND.[00][01ff]

Naomi, tell me something...[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0a00]
...about FoxDie?[00][03ff]

Bloco: 00057659 Size: 0365
00057659
[7594][17fd][0800]
FoxDie is a type of retrovirus that[80][23][80][4e]
targets and kills only specific people.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
First, it infects the macrophages in the[80][23][80][4e]
victim's body.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
FoxDie contains [80][22]smart[80][22] enzymes,[80][23][80][4e]
created through protein engineering.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
They're programmed to respond to[80][23][80][4e]
specific genetic patterns in the cells.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Those enzymes recognize the target's[80][23][80][4e]
DNA?[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
Right. They respond by becoming [80][23][80][4e]
active, and using the macrophages,[80][23][80][4e]
they begin creating TNF epsilon.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Huh?[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
It's a type of cytokine, a peptide[80][23][80][4e]
which causes cells to die.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
The TNF epsilon is carried along the[80][23][80][4e]
bloodstream to the heart, where they[80][23][80][4e]
attach to the TNF receptors in the[80][23][80][4e]
heart cells.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
And then...they cause a heart attack?[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
The heart cells suffer a shock and[80][23][80][4e]
undergo an extreme apoptosis.[80][23][80][4e]
Then...[00][03ff]

Bloco: 000579d2 Size: 0062
000579d2
[7594][08de][0c00]
...the victim dies.[00][01ff]

Apoptosis...you mean the heart cells[80][23][80][4e]
commit suicide...[00][ff00]

Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting[80][23][80][4e]

But I can't go yet. [80][23][80][4e]
I still have a job to do.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][1e00]
Listen, Snake.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
...I'm not the one who made[80][23][80][4e]
the decision to use FoxDie.[00][01ff]

any more unauthorized transmissions.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7222][0000]
What![00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Naomi's been removed from this[80][23][80][4e]
operation.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7222][0000]
What happened to Naomi!?[00][01ff]
[ca21][7222][0000]

that FoxDie was a part of this[80][23][80][4e]
operation!?[00][01ff]
[ca21][7222][0000]
Colonel, let me talk to her![00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
I won't. She's under arrest.[00][01ff]

[8865][2033][0000]
Right now your job is to stop[80][23][80][4e]
Metal Gear![00][01ff]

[226c][ad17][0800]
Thank you, Snake.[00][01ff]

Now the detonation code is[80][23][80][4e]
completed.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0800]
Nothing can stop Metal Gear now.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0600]
Master, what's going on?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
You found the key and even activated[80][23][80][4e]
the warhead for us too. I really must[80][23][80][4e]
express my gratitude.[00][03ff]

Bloco: 00058177 Size: 036a

[226c][c09c][0400]
Sorry to have involved you in that silly[80][23][80][4e]
shape memory alloy business.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0400]
What are you talking about?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
We weren't able to learn the DARPA[80][23][80][4e]
Chief's code.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Even with Mantis' psychic powers, [80][23][80][4e]
he couldn't read his mind.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Then Ocelot accidentally killed him[80][23][80][4e]
during the interrogation.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
In other words, we weren't able to [80][23][80][4e]
launch the nuclear device and we[80][23][80][4e]
were all getting a little worried.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Without the threat of a nuclear strike,[80][23][80][4e]
our demands would never be met.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
What do you mean?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Without the detonation codes, [80][23][80][4e]
we had to find some other way.[00][01ff]
[226c][ad17][0a00]
That's when we decided...you might[80][23][80][4e]
prove useful, Snake.[00][01ff]
[ca21][23ae][0000]
What?[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0200]
First I thought we might get the[80][23][80][4e]
information from you, Snake.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
So I had Decoy Octopus disguise[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][7222][0400]
Just to get me to input the detonation[80][23][80][4e]
code!?[00][01ff]
[226c][ad17][0400]
Huh? You didn't think you made it this[80][23][80][4e]
far by yourself, did you?[00][01ff]
[ca21][7222][0000]
Who the hell are you!?[00][01ff]
[226c][ad17][0000]
In any case, the launch preparations[80][23][80][4e]
are complete.[00][01ff]
[226c][ad17][0000]
Once the world glimpses the power of[80][23][80][4e]
this weapon,[00][01ff]
[226c][ad17][0000]
the White House will have no choice[80][23][80][4e]
but to surrender the FoxDie vaccine[80][23][80][4e]
to me.[00][01ff]

Ace-in-the-hole?[00][01ff]

He's been dead for at least three[80][23][80][4e]

I didn't know because my Codec link[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][b436][0000]
Colonel! Answer me![00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
The Secretary of Defense has taken[80][23][80][4e]
over active control of this operation.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
He's on his way there by AWACS.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0800]
What for?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
To bomb the place.[00][01ff]
[ca21][b436][0400]
What!?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Not only that.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
B-2 Bombers just lifted off from[80][23][80][4e]
Galena Airforce Base.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
They're carrying B61-13 surface-[80][23][80][4e]
piercing tactical nuclear bombs.[00][01ff]
[ca21][b436][0000]
What!? Metal Gear is destroyed.[80][23][80][4e]
Tell the Secretary of Defense![00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0600]
The Secretary of Defense heard that[80][23][80][4e]
Naomi double-crossed us and he's[80][23][80][4e]
worried about FoxDie.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Now that there's no more danger of[80][23][80][4e]
a nuclear strike from Metal Gear,[00][01ff]
[8865][371a][0600]
he's going to do whatever's necessary[80][23][80][4e]
to cover up the truth of what really[80][23][80][4e]
happened here.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0400]
He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to[80][23][80][4e]
vaporize all the evidence along with[80][23][80][4e]

Don't worry, Snake.[00][01ff]

I'll stop the nuclear strike.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0000]
How?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
I may only be a figurehead here, but[80][23][80][4e]
I'm still officially in command of this[80][23][80][4e]
mission.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
If I issue an order to delay the strike,[80][23][80][4e]
it'll confuse the chain of command[80][23][80][4e]
and at least buy you some time.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
It'll give you a chance to escape![00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0000]
But Colonel, if you do that...[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
It's okay, Snake.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
...The truth is FOX-HOUND was[80][23][80][4e]
already the subject of an undercover[80][23][80][4e]
investigation.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Meryl was transferred to this base just[80][23][80][4e]

Roy Campbell has been relieved of[80][23][80][4e]
duty.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
This is the Secretary of Defense,[80][23][80][4e]
Jim Houseman.[00][01ff]
[ca21][b436][0000]
Put the Colonel back on![00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
He's been placed under arrest for[80][23][80][4e]
leaking top-secret information and for[80][23][80][4e]
the crime of high treason.[00][01ff]
[ca21][b436][0400]
Ridiculous![00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
Yes, he's a ridiculous man.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
He truly believed that he was in[80][23][80][4e]
command of this operation.[00][01ff]
[ca21][b436][0000]
You bastard...![00][01ff]

There won't be a speck of evidence[80][23][80][4e]
left.[00][01ff]

I'm sure the President would want the[80][23][80][4e]
same thing.[00][01ff]
[ca21][65c2][0600]
The President ordered this?[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
The President is a busy man.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
I have complete authority here.[00][01ff]
[ca21][65c2][0000]
How do you plan on explaining a[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear attack on Alaska to the media?[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
Don't worry.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
We've prepared a convincing cover[80][23][80][4e]
story.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
We'll simply say that the terrorists[80][23][80][4e]
exploded a nuclear device.[00][01ff]
[ca21][65c2][0000]
...Smart.[00][01ff]
[ca21][b436][0000]
You'll be murdering everyone here.[80][23][80][4e]
The scientists, the Genome Army,[80][23][80][4e]
everyone...[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
Donald...[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
...the DARPA Chief is already dead...[00][01ff]
[ca21][65c2][0000]
So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA[80][23][80][4e]
Chief after all?[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
He was my friend.[00][01ff]
[ca21][65c2][0000]
And you could care less about what[80][23][80][4e]
happens to everybody else, huh?[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
Well, if you give me the optic disc,[80][23][80][4e]
I might consider saving them.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0400]
What are you talking about?[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
Metal Gear's test data![00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
Donald was supposed to bring it back.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7e0b][0000]
I don't have it.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0000]
I see.[80][23][80][4e]
Oh well that's okay...[00][01ff]
[95fb][2fbf][0400]
You two are an embarrassment from[80][23][80][4e]
the 1970's.[00][01ff]
[95fb][2fbf][0000]
...our country's dirty little secret.[00][01ff]
[95fb][2fbf][0000]
You can't be allowed to live.[00][01ff]
[95fb][f993][0400]
Well, the bombs will be dropping[80][23][80][4e]
soon, and you two have a lot of[80][23][80][4e]
catching up to do.[00][01ff]

You can take the loading tunnel to[80][23][80][4e]

There's a parking garage right next[80][23][80][4e]

I'll bet the boys at the DIA and the[80][23][80][4e]

home alive.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I better not show my face around[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
That's not too far from the truth.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]

you on Fox Island.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Okay, Roy.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Are you going to be okay?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Don't worry. I've got an insurance[80][23][80][4e]

The battery on these nanomachines[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]

[8865][2033][0000]

Really?[80][23][80][4e]
I'll look forward to that.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0800]

[8865][2033][0600]
What?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
About FoxDie.[00][01ff]

you face to face about that.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
How is she?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0400]
Don't worry.[00][01ff]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Do you know something?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That door sometimes gets frozen shut[80][23][80][4e]
cause it's so cold outside.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Next time tell me beforehand.[80][23][80][4e]
So what should I do?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It's impossible to open from the[80][23][80][4e]

something from the outside...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
From the outside? You can't[80][23][80][4e]
open it from the inside?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Sorry, it's impossible. But don't worry,[80][23][80][4e]
you'll get through. There are two[80][23][80][4e]
walkways that connect Tower A and[80][23][80][4e]
Tower B. The other one's on the roof.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]

It's no good, Snake. It looks like that[80][23][80][4e]
door is frozen shut. The only way to[80][23][80][4e]
open it is to blow it open from[80][23][80][4e]
the outside.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And since the walkway on the roof is[80][23][80][4e]
destroyed, to get to Tower B, you'll[80][23][80][4e]
have to take the walkway on the other[80][23][80][4e]
side of that door.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]

up so that you could take one elevator[80][23][80][4e]
all the way to the bottom,[00][01ff]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Well, I found lots of information about[80][23][80][4e]
that new nuclear weapon...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
There are 4 stages involved in[80][23][80][4e]
launching a ballistic missile. [80][23][80][4e]
The first one is the Boost Stage.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It starts at the point the missile is[80][23][80][4e]
launched and ends after all the rocket[80][23][80][4e]
fuel is burned and the missile is[80][23][80][4e]
propelled into the exosphere.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The next stage is the Post-Boost[80][23][80][4e]
Stage. It starts after all the fuel is[80][23][80][4e]
burned and ends after the re-entry[80][23][80][4e]
vehicle is ejected.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Next is the Intermediate Course[80][23][80][4e]
Stage. It takes place after the[80][23][80][4e]
re-entry vehicle is ejected and lasts[80][23][80][4e]
until the missile enters the exosphere.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Then comes the Final Stage. It starts[80][23][80][4e]
when the re-entry vehicle enters the[80][23][80][4e]
exosphere and it lasts until it reaches[80][23][80][4e]
its ultimate target on the ground.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Missile defense systems use military[80][23][80][4e]
satellites to detect rocket emissions[80][23][80][4e]
during the initial Boost Stage of[80][23][80][4e]
a missile.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
But this new nuclear weapon employs[80][23][80][4e]
the rail gun's ability to fire projectiles[80][23][80][4e]
at ultra-high velocities, instead of[80][23][80][4e]
using a rocket.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That's why it can't be detected by[80][23][80][4e]
today's missile defense systems![00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And on top of that, the re-entry[80][23][80][4e]
vehicle also uses Stealth technology...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It's so accurate that its fifty percent[80][23][80][4e]
zone comes close to 50 meters. [80][23][80][4e]
That's as good as the best ICBM.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
A highly accurate, undetectable,[80][23][80][4e]
uninterceptable nuclear weapon.[80][23][80][4e]
We wouldn't even be able to tell[80][23][80][4e]
where it came from...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And that's not all. A standard ballistic[80][23][80][4e]
missile uses a 2-stage or a 3-stage[80][23][80][4e]
solid fuel rocket for its propulsion[80][23][80][4e]
system.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Besides costing lots of money, safely[80][23][80][4e]
maintaining the solid rocket fuel and[80][23][80][4e]
readying the missile for launch[80][23][80][4e]
requires a lot of work.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
But a railgun-launched nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
warhead avoids all of those[80][23][80][4e]
problems. And it's cheap too.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
It's the perfect nuke. A general's[80][23][80][4e]
dream...[00][01ff]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]
I found out a lot about the arms[80][23][80][4e]
industry though...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
After the Cold War ended, the United[80][23][80][4e]
States slashed its defense budget by[80][23][80][4e]
more than 15%. Naturally, the arms[80][23][80][4e]
industry was severely affected.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It resulted in an orgy of mergers and[80][23][80][4e]
acquisitions.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Some of the big arms conglomerates[80][23][80][4e]
today are made up of what 10 years[80][23][80][4e]
ago would have been 20 or more[80][23][80][4e]
smaller arms companies.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
ArmsTech is one of those. But we lost[80][23][80][4e]
our bid to produce the US Air Force's[80][23][80][4e]
next line of fighter jets.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Then we took a stab at civilian[80][23][80][4e]
applications, but that was a failure too.[80][23][80][4e]
The company was about to go belly[80][23][80][4e]
up.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Ironically, the Defense Department[80][23][80][4e]
was in pretty much the same situation.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Thanks to big budget cuts, they were[80][23][80][4e]
forced to turn to the private sector to[80][23][80][4e]
help fund their weapons development.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
On top of that, the government began[80][23][80][4e]
to actively export their advanced[80][23][80][4e]
weapons technology to the private[80][23][80][4e]
sector...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
...in order to maintain a high standard[80][23][80][4e]
of quality in the country's defense[80][23][80][4e]
armaments.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Eventually they decided on a joint[80][23][80][4e]
development project for new weapon[80][23][80][4e]
systems between the DOD and the[80][23][80][4e]
private sector.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
And...since both sides were in such[80][23][80][4e]
bad financial shape, that's where all[80][23][80][4e]
the backscratching came in.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
So there was another reason for the[80][23][80][4e]
joint development of Metal Gear, huh.[80][23][80][4e]
It wasn't just President Baker trying to[80][23][80][4e]
keep ArmsTech afloat...[00][ff00]

That key is actually an IC card. [80][23][80][4e]
Its connector pins and main body [80][23][80][4e]
are made of a shape memory alloy.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It's designed so that unless it has[80][23][80][4e]
been changed to the correct shape,[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
it won't be recognized by the PAL[80][23][80][4e]
code input terminal in the Control[80][23][80][4e]

[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Go and put it into the middle terminal[80][23][80][4e]

Snake, Rex's armor is impregnable.[80][23][80][4e]
You can't do any damage with the[80][23][80][4e]
weapons you've got.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Rex uses the latest advances in[80][23][80][4e]
compound armor.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The only way you can pierce it is[80][23][80][4e]
with a high performance HEAT (high[80][23][80][4e]
explosive, anti-tank) round.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So what do I do?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Rex's pilot seat operates exactly like[80][23][80][4e]
a VR system.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It's got multiple sensors connected[80][23][80][4e]
to a high tech interface used for[80][23][80][4e]
the controls.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
It's completely self-enclosed and [80][23][80][4e]
shut off from the outside environment.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
He's not using his naked eyes?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That's right. So if you could somehow[80][23][80][4e]
destroy the sensors...[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Do you see that round plate on [80][23][80][4e]
Rex's left arm?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah, that thing that looks like[80][23][80][4e]
a shield?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That's a radome. If you can destroy[80][23][80][4e]
that thing, it won't be able to use its[80][23][80][4e]
electronic equipment.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So he'll be blinded?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Yeah. Try to hit that radome with[80][23][80][4e]
a Stinger missile.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So that will stop it?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
No, Rex was designed so it can be[80][23][80][4e]
controlled manually too.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Oh great.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The part that looks like a beak[80][23][80][4e]
is where the pilot seat is. In an[80][23][80][4e]
emergency it will open up.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Rex's armor is perfect. [80][23][80][4e]
You can't destroy it.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You told me that already.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
But the interior is a different story.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I get it...first I destroy the radome.[80][23][80][4e]
That will force him to open up[80][23][80][4e]
the pilot's seat.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Right. If you can shoot a Stinger[80][23][80][4e]
missile into the cockpit, you'll destroy[80][23][80][4e]
the computer control system.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You intentionally designed it with[80][23][80][4e]
a weak point?[00][01ff]
[2c3d][4a28][0600]
It's not a weak point. I like to think of[80][23][80][4e]
it as a character flaw. People just[80][23][80][4e]
aren't complete without some type of[80][23][80][4e]
character flaw, don't you think?[00][01ff]
[ca21][2872][0600]
I guess so. I owe you one, Otacon.[00][0000]

Rex is equipped with anti-tank[80][23][80][4e]
missiles on both of his knees.[80][23][80][4e]
They're a laser semi-active homing[80][23][80][4e]
type that doesn't use wires.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
The shooter uses a laser illuminator to[80][23][80][4e]
bounce a laser beam off the target.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
After that, the missile uses the light[80][23][80][4e]
reflected off the target to home in[80][23][80][4e]
on it.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
Fortunately, the missiles are tipped[80][23][80][4e]
with HEAT rounds and not anti-[80][23][80][4e]
personnel warheads. But if they hit[80][23][80][4e]
you directly, you'll be sorry. Be careful.[00][0000]

The rail gun uses magnetism to fire[80][23][80][4e]
projectiles.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
By perfecting the process of shell[80][23][80][4e]
acceleration, the railgun is able to fire[80][23][80][4e]
a projectile with a muzzle velocity of[80][23][80][4e]
over 100 kilometers per second.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]

Rex is the first actual prototype[80][23][80][4e]
model, but they've been doing [80][23][80][4e]
virtual prototyping for a while now.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
They pop it into a VR simulation while[80][23][80][4e]
it's still in the design phase.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]
That way they can make[80][23][80][4e]
improvements to the design while[80][23][80][4e]
testing it under all sorts of simulated[80][23][80][4e]
conditions.[00][01ff]
[2c3d][5dad][0000]

hanging from a long stick that you[80][23][80][4e]
carry on your back.[00][01ff]

Apparently Raven does it with six men.[00][0000]

Snake, I'm sure that woman calling[80][23][80][4e]
herself Naomi is some type of spy.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
And now I'm starting to think that[80][23][80][4e]

too. Don't trust him.[00][ff00]

Campbell is hiding something too...[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
But that's okay. FoxDie is a virus...[80][23][80][4e]
a biological weapon. There must be[80][23][80][4e]
a vaccine.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
We can worry about getting that later,[80][23][80][4e]
Snake, but right now you've got to[80][23][80][4e]
focus on re-inputting those detonation[80][23][80][4e]

So Naomi used FoxDie to take her[80][23][80][4e]
revenge on you...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah, but she said she wasn't the one[80][23][80][4e]
who made the decision to use it.[80][23][80][4e]
According to her, it was just one part[80][23][80][4e]
of this operation.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Hmmm. If this goes all the way up to[80][23][80][4e]

War brings out the cruelty of man. [80][23][80][4e]
No matter how the soldier was brought[80][23][80][4e]

Sometimes, even though you know [80][23][80][4e]
it's a losing battle, you just have to fight[80][23][80][4e]

Foresight is important in war. In times[80][23][80][4e]
of extreme danger, people's latent[80][23][80][4e]
sixth sense often awakens.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
When that happens, throw logic to the[80][23][80][4e]

When the temperature falls down to[80][23][80][4e]

you start to get ice fogs. That's when[80][23][80][4e]
the moisture in the air freezes.[00][01ff]

to change your underwear if you're[80][23][80][4e]

by eating snow.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
You'll freeze your stomach and your[80][23][80][4e]

Look slowly from a light area to a[80][23][80][4e]

[226c][c09c][0000]
If you do that, your eyes will gradually[80][23][80][4e]
adjust and you'll be able to see better[80][23][80][4e]

When you're fighting in the dark, [80][23][80][4e]
you need to use your sense of hearing[80][23][80][4e]

use your ears.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]

The most important tools you need to[80][23][80][4e]

training can change those.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]

[226c][c09c][0000]
Then as you slowly lower the tip of[80][23][80][4e]
your foot to the floor, gradually shift[80][23][80][4e]
your weight onto that foot.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Use your knees to maintain the subtle[80][23][80][4e]
balance. Try it.[00][01ff]
[ca21][7222][0400]
I...I can't do it...[00][01ff]

The muzzle velocity of a bullet fired[80][23][80][4e]
from a revolver is slower than one[80][23][80][4e]
fired from an automatic. That's bad for[80][23][80][4e]
you.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
The slower a gun's muzzle velocity,[80][23][80][4e]
the more damage it does.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
That's cause the bullet will tend to[80][23][80][4e]
lodge in the body instead of going[80][23][80][4e]
right through.[00][01ff]
[226c][c09c][0000]
Those kind of wounds take a long[80][23][80][4e]
time to heal. Sometimes they never[80][23][80][4e]
do. I think that's part of the reason he[80][23][80][4e]
likes that gun.[00][01ff]

He worked with the FBI on several[80][23][80][4e]

Five years ago he was working on[80][23][80][4e]

acetylcholine, an important[80][23][80][4e]
neurotransmitter.[00][01ff]

And you don't have to breathe it in for[80][23][80][4e]
it to kill you. It can enter your body[80][23][80][4e]
through skin contact as well.[00][01ff]

headache, or difficulty with breathing.[00][01ff]

contain benzopyrene, a chemical that[80][23][80][4e]

[7594][f321][0600]

enters the body, it changes to[80][23][80][4e]
benzopyrene diolepoxide (BPDE)[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0600]

The tranquilizer that Wolf is using is[80][23][80][4e]
diazepam.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Diazepam?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
It's a benzodiazepam based anti-[80][23][80][4e]
anxiety drug. It has a strong effect on[80][23][80][4e]
the central nervous system and it's[80][23][80][4e]
often used as a psychotropic drug.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So how does it stop your hands from[80][23][80][4e]
trembling?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
Anti-anxiety drugs are also effective[80][23][80][4e]
as muscle relaxants. They're widely[80][23][80][4e]
used to treat psychosomatic disorders[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
such as autonomic ataxia or as[80][23][80][4e]
pre-anesthetics to relax patients[80][23][80][4e]
before an operation.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I see.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
But be careful. If diazepam is used in[80][23][80][4e]
large doses over a long period of[80][23][80][4e]
time, it becomes addictive like[80][23][80][4e]
alcohol.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
An adult should take no more than[80][23][80][4e]
one to four doses per day, with each[80][23][80][4e]

000b2854;000bd404
[7594][f321][0400]
How do you feel, Snake?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Well, to tell you the truth, I think I'm[80][23][80][4e]
catching a cold...[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0600]
I'm monitoring you via the[80][23][80][4e]
nanomachines...Your body[80][23][80][4e]
temperature is elevated and your[80][23][80][4e]
lymph nodes are slightly swollen.[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
But don't worry, it appears to be just a[80][23][80][4e]
mild rhinovirus.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I guess I got it from that soldier.[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
I've increased your nutrition and[80][23][80][4e]
elevated your blood sugar level.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You can't cure it?[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
Sorry, Snake.[80][23][80][4e]
The nanomachines don't carry[80][23][80][4e]
antibiotics.[00][01ff]
[7594][76b1][0000]
Maybe you could find some garlic. It[80][23][80][4e]
contains natural antibiotics, you know.[80][23][80][4e]
Vitamins and minerals too.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Uhhh. Raw garlic. Gimme a break.[00][06ff]

There must be some cold medicine[80][23][80][4e]
somewhere on the base. That would[80][23][80][4e]
make you feel better.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
If not, you'll just have to wait until your[80][23][80][4e]
body's natural defenses take over.[00][0000]

[8865][2033][0000]
Good, you've got yourself a weapon.[80][23][80][4e]
To use it, first hold down the R2[80][23][80][4e]
Button to enter [80][22]Weapon Mode.[80][22][00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Then select the weapon you want with[80][23][80][4e]
the Directional Button.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
After you've selected the weapon you[80][23][80][4e]
want, let go of the R2 Button to exit[80][23][80][4e]
[80][22]Weapon Mode.[80][22] The weapon you[80][23][80][4e]
selected should appear in your hand.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
To use the weapon, follow the[80][23][80][4e]
directions displayed in the window.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
If you use the R1 Button, you can[80][23][80][4e]
equip your weapon more quickly.[80][23][80][4e]
While you're barehanded,[80][23][80][4e]
press the R1 Button to equip the last[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
weapon you used. Press the R1[80][23][80][4e]
Button while you're holding a weapon[80][23][80][4e]
to be barehanded again.[00][ff00]

Don't fire your gun needlessly or you[80][23][80][4e]

Can you see the green dot flashing on[80][23][80][4e]
your radar? That's coming from the[80][23][80][4e]

It looks like the Chief is being held in[80][23][80][4e]

how to use the Codec system.[00][ff00]

[8865][2033][0000]
Snake, if you want to send a[80][23][80][4e]
transmission, first press the Select[80][23][80][4e]
Button. That will put you in Codec[80][23][80][4e]
Mode.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
When you're at the Codec Screen,[80][23][80][4e]
press the right or left Directional[80][23][80][4e]
Button to change the frequency.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Then press up on the Directional[80][23][80][4e]
Button or press the O Button to[80][23][80][4e]
transmit at that frequency.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
The Codec also automatically stores[80][23][80][4e]
the frequencies of the people you've[80][23][80][4e]
spoken to. To open the Memory[80][23][80][4e]
Window,[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
press down on the Directional Button[80][23][80][4e]
at the Codec Screen.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
The Memory Window will show a list of[80][23][80][4e]
all the frequencies. All you have to do[80][23][80][4e]
is to select the frequency you want[80][23][80][4e]
and press the O Button to transmit.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
If you want to switch back to the[80][23][80][4e]
normal Codec Mode, just press [80][23][80][4e]
the Select or X Button.[00][0000]

[8865][2033][0000]
If you're spotted, all the enemies will[80][23][80][4e]
come to attack you at once. That's[80][23][80][4e]
Alert Mode. [00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
In that case, there's only two ways to[80][23][80][4e]
get out of danger.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Either kill all the enemies that are[80][23][80][4e]
coming after you, or escape from them[80][23][80][4e]
for a certain amount of time.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
You'll see a timer in the upper right[80][23][80][4e]
radar portion of the screen.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
That will tell you how much more time[80][23][80][4e]
you need to stay out of sight in order[80][23][80][4e]
to get out of Alert Mode.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
If you can escape until that counter[80][23][80][4e]
reaches zero, the enemies will stop[80][23][80][4e]
attacking you and you'll enter Evasion[80][23][80][4e]
Mode.[00][06ff]

[7594][f321][0400]
But don't relax just because you're in[80][23][80][4e]
Evasion Mode. The enemies will still[80][23][80][4e]
be looking for you, so make sure you[80][23][80][4e]
stay hidden so they can't find you.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
When the counter in the radar portion[80][23][80][4e]
of the screen reaches zero again, the[80][23][80][4e]
enemies will return to their positions.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]

Not only that. When you're not holding[80][23][80][4e]

[8865][2033][0000]
pressing the Weapon Button while[80][23][80][4e]

Snake, get out of there and go to the[80][23][80][4e]
2nd floor basement. You've got to[80][23][80][4e]
rescue the president of ArmsTech,[80][23][80][4e]
Kenneth Baker,[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
before the terrorists find out his[80][23][80][4e]
detonation code.[00][0000]

[8865][2033][0000]
Good. Looks like it worked. If what[80][23][80][4e]
the DARPA Chief said is true,[80][23][80][4e]
President Baker should be up ahead.[80][23][80][4e]
Hurry up and get him out of there.[00][0000]

[8865][2033][0000]
The walls that were cemented over[80][23][80][4e]
should look slightly different. Look at[80][23][80][4e]
the walls carefully in First Person View[80][23][80][4e]

[8865][2033][0000]
You'll need some kind of explosive to[80][23][80][4e]
destroy the wall...like C4 or something.[80][23][80][4e]

Also, you can't use your radar around[80][23][80][4e]

[8865][2033][0400]
That's right. If the terrorists get[80][23][80][4e]
Baker's code, they'll be able to[80][23][80][4e]
launch that nuke anytime they want.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]

Snake, now that the terrorists have[80][23][80][4e]
both detonation codes, the only way[80][23][80][4e]
to stop a nuclear launch is to either[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0200]
use the detonation code release keys[80][23][80][4e]
that Meryl's holding, or...[00][01ff]

They try to put on a pretty face for the[80][23][80][4e]
media, but this is the grim reality of it.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Nastasha knows lots more about it[80][23][80][4e]
than I do. [00][03ff]

[7594][f321][0400]
All of the warheads in those boxes[80][23][80][4e]
have had their detonation mechanisms[80][23][80][4e]
removed so there's no fear of them[80][23][80][4e]
exploding.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0400]
But if the warheads are broken, they[80][23][80][4e]
might leak plutonium and that would[80][23][80][4e]
be a serious problem.[00][ff00]

[8865][2033][0200]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
That stealth camouflage, it's him. [80][23][80][4e]
It must be![00][01ff]
[8865][565e][0200]
Snake! Emmerich's in danger! [80][23][80][4e]
Hurry and go after him![00][ff00]

[7594][f321][0400]
I'm sorry, but there's no one in [80][23][80][4e]
FOX-HOUND like that.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
There are currently only six members[80][23][80][4e]
of FOX-HOUND.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, [80][23][80][4e]
Vulcan Raven, Decoy Octopus, [80][23][80][4e]
Revolver Ocelot...[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
And finally Liquid Snake.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
The Genome soldiers under his[80][23][80][4e]
command are Next Generation[80][23][80][4e]
Special Forces.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
FOX-HOUND is intended to be [80][23][80][4e]
a small number of highly elite,[80][23][80][4e]
hand-picked soldiers.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You're talking about the current [80][23][80][4e]
FOX-HOUND, right?[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
Yes...[00][06ff]

Snake, who or what is that thing? [80][23][80][4e]
Is he an enemy or not?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
That's what I'd like to know. Naomi,[80][23][80][4e]
you really don't have any idea?[00][06ff]

Bloco: 000ba4d4 Size: 006c

[7594][17fd][0400]
...Maybe I should ask you the same[80][23][80][4e]
thing.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
What?[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
Nothing...forget about it.[00][ff00]

Bloco: 000ba56e Size: 003a

provoke you.[00][0000]

Bloco: 000ba5cd Size: 0065
000ba5cd
[8865][2033][0000]
Snake, he's obviously trying to[80][23][80][4e]

and take him on.[00][0000]

Bloco: 000ba650 Size: 0066
000ba650
[8865][2033][0000]

something else.[00][0000]

Bloco: 000ba6c9 Size: 0068

[8865][2033][0000]
He's fast! If you lose sight of him,[80][23][80][4e]

look for him.[00][0000]

Bloco: 000ba7a4 Size: 0162

[8865][2033][0000]
Well it looks like you've rescued[80][23][80][4e]
Emmerich for the time being.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah. With that stealth camouflage,[80][23][80][4e]
he should be able to hide safely.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Gray Fox...I can't believe it...But the[80][23][80][4e]
real problem is your niece. The way[80][23][80][4e]
the Codec got cut off like that has me[80][23][80][4e]
worried.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Something must have happened to[80][23][80][4e]
her...[00][06ff]

[7594][f321][0400]
You're worried? About Meryl?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Not exactly. It's just that she's holding[80][23][80][4e]
the detonation code override keys.[80][23][80][4e]
They're our last chance of stopping[80][23][80][4e]
that nuclear launch.[00][03ff]

[7594][17fd][0600]
You're a cold man. Your mission is[80][23][80][4e]
more important than the life of your[80][23][80][4e]
companions?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
This is war. Survival is the name of the[80][23][80][4e]
game. Sometimes you have to be cold[80][23][80][4e]
to survive.[00][01ff]
[7594][17fd][0000]
Yes, but...[00][06ff]

Bloco: 000bac4a Size: 00e3

[8865][2033][0000]
So Meryl's disguised as an enemy[80][23][80][4e]
soldier, huh? Well even so, you should[80][23][80][4e]
be able to spot her if you look close[80][23][80][4e]
enough.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Use either First Person View or Corner[80][23][80][4e]

[8865][2033][0000]
Didn't Meryl say that she's somewhere[80][23][80][4e]

searching in that building.[00][0000]

Bloco: 000bae58 Size: 0089
000bae58
[8865][2033][0000]
Meryl said that she's close by. She's[80][23][80][4e]
probably in the Warhead Storage[80][23][80][4e]

looking there.[00][0000]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
We can't relax...not yet.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0800]
I know. Snake...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
She is quite a woman.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
As commander of this operation, [80][23][80][4e]
I can't ask you to watch after Meryl,[80][23][80][4e]
but...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Duty first?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Maybe I was wrong...sending my own[80][23][80][4e]
flesh and blood to war.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
She understands about duty.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
I know she does...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
But what I want to know is what was[80][23][80][4e]
the real purpose of this military[80][23][80][4e]
exercise?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
I don't know. Like I said, I'm nothing[80][23][80][4e]
more than a middleman.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Is this transmission being monitored[80][23][80][4e]
by the military?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Of course.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I get it. All the world's a stage and[80][23][80][4e]
we're merely players, right?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Yes, but even players can influence[80][23][80][4e]
the play.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
I just hope we can prevent it from[80][23][80][4e]
having a bad ending.[00][ff00]

You're seeing what he's seeing. It's a[80][23][80][4e]

you can use that to find him![00][0000]

Be careful. Wolves have the[80][23][80][4e]

they see better, but they have a keen[80][23][80][4e]
sense of smell as well.[00][01ff]

sights never straying from her target.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
And on top of that, she takes[80][23][80][4e]

Wait a minute, Snake. According to[80][23][80][4e]
these satellite photos that Mei Ling[80][23][80][4e]
got, it looks as if there's a walkway on[80][23][80][4e]
the roof as well.[00][06ff]

Grenades might work well too. To get[80][23][80][4e]
the grenade to explode near the[80][23][80][4e]

Colonel, there's an elevator,[80][23][80][4e]
but it's stuck on a floor below.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
That elevator can probably only be[80][23][80][4e]
moved from below.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
There must be some other way down.[80][23][80][4e]
Look around.[00][ff00]

Snake, that's a blast furnace.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
A blast furnace?[80][23][80][4e]
What do they use that for?[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
There's no airport on the base, [80][23][80][4e]
so it's hard to bring in supplies.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
They must have built a blast furnace[80][23][80][4e]
so they could make building materials[80][23][80][4e]
and such.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
That makes sense.[80][23][80][4e]

Vulcan Raven is half Native Alaskan[80][23][80][4e]
American and half Inuit. He was raised[80][23][80][4e]
as a shaman and they say he has[80][23][80][4e]
supernatural powers.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
During the Cold War, he trained in[80][23][80][4e]
Russia with the Bimpel, the Soviet[80][23][80][4e]
special forces. [00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
In 1993, he was demoted by[80][23][80][4e]
President Yeltsin following his coup[80][23][80][4e]
d'etat. So he fled the country and[80][23][80][4e]
became a mercenary.[00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]
After that, he joined those rent-a-war[80][23][80][4e]
bastards at [80][22]Outer Heaven Inc.[80][22][00][01ff]
[7594][f321][0000]

That cannon he's holding is a 20[80][23][80][4e]

them mounted on fighter planes.[00][01ff]

[8865][2033][0000]
Try attacking him with a[80][23][80][4e]
Remote-Controlled Missile. Maneuver[80][23][80][4e]
it between the containers to get it to[80][23][80][4e]
come up behind him.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
But if you fly the missiles too slow,[80][23][80][4e]
they'll get shot down even if they[80][23][80][4e]
approach him from behind.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Try to get them close by flying them[80][23][80][4e]

around corners.[00][0000]

Emmerich?[00][01ff]

Use your binoculars.[00][01ff]
[8865][2033][0000]
Then attack with a PSG-1 or Remote[80][23][80][4e]

That M1 tank is equipped with[80][23][80][4e]
advanced vetronics.[80][23][80][4e]
Once it locks on to a target, it[80][23][80][4e]
automatically tracks it,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
and its main gun is effective up to[80][23][80][4e]
3000 meters.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
To get close, you'll have to confuse[80][23][80][4e]
its tracking system. Use your Chaff.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
If you can jam the system and get[80][23][80][4e]
close enough, it won't be able to use[80][23][80][4e]

Even if you can get close, the M1[80][23][80][4e]
tank's maximum speed is 45 miles per[80][23][80][4e]
hour. First, you'll have to slow it down.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Go after its caterpillars with C4 or[80][23][80][4e]
Grenades.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Once it slows down, toss a Grenade in[80][23][80][4e]
the commander's turret.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The M1 has exceptionally strong[80][23][80][4e]
armor.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
With your weapons, the only way to[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]
That Hind is a monster. You have only[80][23][80][4e]
a small chance to win, but at least[80][23][80][4e]
it's better than no chance...[00][01ff]

[af33][8d15][0000]
As long as the strategy of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
deterrence continues, nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapons may be reduced, but[80][23][80][4e]
they will never be eliminated.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0400]
If you think about it, nuclear reduction[80][23][80][4e]
does not mean much without[80][23][80][4e]
elimination as the ultimate goal.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
I used to work in the DIA (Defense[80][23][80][4e]
Intelligence Agency). I figured the[80][23][80][4e]
only way to achieve nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
elimination...[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
...was to work from the inside to[80][23][80][4e]
convince them of the ineffectiveness[80][23][80][4e]
of the deterrence theory.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Seems like you're pretty focused on[80][23][80][4e]
that issue.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0800]
...Victims of nuclear radiation are a sad[80][23][80][4e]
thing to see...and I have seen a lot of[80][23][80][4e]
it.[00][01ff]
[af33][411e][0800]
...I have seen more than enough of it...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
?[00][01ff]
[af33][411e][0000]
I was born and raised in Prypiat,[80][23][80][4e]
Ukraine. I was 10 years old on that[80][23][80][4e]
day...April 26, 1986.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
You don't mean...[00][01ff]
[af33][411e][0000]
Yes. Chernobyl. That is the day that[80][23][80][4e]
changed my life and thousands of[80][23][80][4e]
other lives. I lived just three[80][23][80][4e]
kilometers north of there.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
..........[00][01ff]
[af33][411e][0000]
600,000-700,000 people were[80][23][80][4e]
evacuated. Over 650,000 children[80][23][80][4e]
suffered the effects of radiation[80][23][80][4e]
poisoning.[00][01ff]
[af33][411e][0000]
Between 1986 and 1993,[80][23][80][4e]
12,000 children died...[00][01ff]
[af33][411e][0000]
My parents, and many others like[80][23][80][4e]
them who helped in the cleanup,[80][23][80][4e]
died a few years later from radiation[80][23][80][4e]
sickness.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0800]
We must rid this world of all nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapons...before they cause more[80][23][80][4e]
misery.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Before they destroy the delicate[80][23][80][4e]
environment that keeps us alive.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
I will not allow this pain and anxiety to[80][23][80][4e]
pass on to yet another generation.[00][ff00]

An organophosphate nerve agent is a[80][23][80][4e]
gas which invades an animal's nerves.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It was first used as a weapon in World[80][23][80][4e]
War II, and the casualties resulting[80][23][80][4e]
from it were tremendous.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In its pure form, it is a colorless,[80][23][80][4e]
odorless gas. That gas was probably[80][23][80][4e]
colored yellow to make it easier to[80][23][80][4e]
detect in the case of a leak.[00][ff00]

Harasho...good![80][23][80][4e]
You found a SOCOM. That's a Special[80][23][80][4e]
Operations Command Pistol.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It's a .45 caliber pistol with plenty of[80][23][80][4e]
stopping power.[80][23][80][4e]
It's also equipped with a LAM (Laser[80][23][80][4e]
Aiming Module) for night-time combat.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
If you hold down the Weapon Button,[80][23][80][4e]
you can train the laser sight on the[80][23][80][4e]
enemy to help you aim.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
If you find a SOCOM suppressor,[80][23][80][4e]
you can equip that, too.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
That pistol was designed specifically[80][23][80][4e]
for use by special forces, so I think it[80][23][80][4e]
will be useful.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

Those are Stun Grenades.[80][23][80][4e]
They are often used in sensitive[80][23][80][4e]
operations such as freeing hostages[80][23][80][4e]
and that sort of thing.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Sometimes they are called [80][22]flash[80][23][80][4e]
bangs[80][22] or  [80][22]sound and flash[80][23][80][4e]
grenades.[80][22][00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They make a big flash and lots of[80][23][80][4e]
noise which will disorient and disable[80][23][80][4e]
your opponents temporarily.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

in almost any way you want.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Although it has 1.4 times the[80][23][80][4e]
destructive power of dynamite,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
it is highly stable and won't explode[80][23][80][4e]
without a detonating device, even if it[80][23][80][4e]
is shot, burned or beaten.[00][01ff]

You are using a wireless[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]

Unlike other mines, which are planted[80][23][80][4e]
underground,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
claymores are set up above ground[80][23][80][4e]

maximum damage in a wide-fan[80][23][80][4e]
shaped area.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
When they go off, they spray seven[80][23][80][4e]

in a 60 degree pattern much like an[80][23][80][4e]

Excellent! That is a PSG-1. One of[80][23][80][4e]
the best sniper rifles in the world.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is accurate enough to shoot cleanly[80][23][80][4e]
through a 2.5 centimeter square from[80][23][80][4e]
a distance of 100 meters.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Unlike other sniper rifles, the PSG-1 is[80][23][80][4e]
not bolt-action, it is semi-automatic.[80][23][80][4e]
Its best feature is that it allows for[80][23][80][4e]
rapid fire.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
When you are shooting over long[80][23][80][4e]
distances, the slightest tremble can[80][23][80][4e]
make you miss your target by inches.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Try to keep your hands as still as[80][23][80][4e]
possible.[00][ff00]

[af33][8d15][0000]
You found Stinger missiles. Great![00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They are equipped with a thermal[80][23][80][4e]
homing device, so once they locked[80][23][80][4e]
on they will automatically pursue[80][23][80][4e]
the target.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
To lock on, all you have to do is line[80][23][80][4e]
up the crosshairs.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Stingers are very potent, short-range,[80][23][80][4e]
low-altitude SAMs. In Afghanistan, the[80][23][80][4e]
Mujahaddin shot down hundreds of[80][23][80][4e]
Soviet aircraft with them.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In fact, they were forced to change[80][23][80][4e]
their tactics.[00][01ff]
[af33][7990][0800]
One of my favorite horror books is[80][23][80][4e]
called Stinger and my favorite cocktail[80][23][80][4e]
is a Stinger. I guess you could say I've[80][23][80][4e]

Good.[80][23][80][4e]
You found a Suppressor for the[80][23][80][4e]
SOCOM pistol.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
If you equip that, you won't have to[80][23][80][4e]
worry about being noticed by the[80][23][80][4e]
enemy when you fire.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It will greatly reduce the sound and[80][23][80][4e]
flash from your muzzle.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It uses a multi-layered chamber to[80][23][80][4e]
lower the velocity of the gas emissions[80][23][80][4e]
and thus reduce the sound and flash[80][23][80][4e]
when you fire your weapon.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The Suppressor is narrow enough so[80][23][80][4e]
that you can still use the gun's original[80][23][80][4e]
sight even when it is equipped.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It shouldn't change the feel when you[80][23][80][4e]
fire it.[00][ff00]

That is a Mine Detector. It works by[80][23][80][4e]
searching for metal objects.[80][23][80][4e]
It will even find Claymores that are[80][23][80][4e]
hidden with optic stealth technology.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is set so that the position of the land[80][23][80][4e]
mines will show up on your radar.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
All you have to do is equip the mine[80][23][80][4e]
detector and keep an eye on your[80][23][80][4e]
radar. Use it carefully.[00][ff00]

[af33][8d15][0000]
A cardboard box.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
A cardboard box usually consists of a[80][23][80][4e]
thin pasteboard with a corrugated[80][23][80][4e]
paper center. They are usually made[80][23][80][4e]
of recycled paper.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It was first invented in Europe over a[80][23][80][4e]
hundred years ago.[80][23][80][4e]
It was originally used to absorb one's[80][23][80][4e]
sweat when wearing hats.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
With the same amount of wood to[80][23][80][4e]
make one wooden box, you can make[80][23][80][4e]
six or seven cardboard boxes.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
And since it's recyclable, it's highly[80][23][80][4e]
economical. In addition, It is strong[80][23][80][4e]
and easy to store. That's why it's[80][23][80][4e]
widely used for packing.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But to avoid damaging weapons and[80][23][80][4e]
other delicate instruments when[80][23][80][4e]
shipping them, they should be[80][23][80][4e]
packed in stronger boxes, like...[80][23][80][4e]
[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
wood or something.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Also, the crevices should be filled with[80][23][80][4e]
Styrofoam to prevent them from[80][23][80][4e]
moving around.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0600]
...So anyway, what's with the box?[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...Oh nothing...no big deal.[00][ff00]

[af33][8d15][0000]
You got a Gas Mask. Good.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
That is a double eye-piece type. Be[80][23][80][4e]
careful. Unlike the transparent shield[80][23][80][4e]
type, it will restrict your field of vision.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is equipped with a voice emitter,[80][23][80][4e]
so do not worry about not being [80][23][80][4e]
heard.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The outside is made of reinforced [80][23][80][4e]
plastic and the inside is made from [80][23][80][4e]
an acetate weave.[80][23][80][4e]
[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Also the eye pieces are specially [80][23][80][4e]
treated so they won't fog up.[80][23][80][4e]
[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

Those are Night-Vision Goggles.[80][23][80][4e]
They do not use special lenses.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They electronically amplify the light by[80][23][80][4e]
transforming it into electric signals[80][23][80][4e]
which they then boost to create an[80][23][80][4e]
image.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They amplify the light 100,000 times.[80][23][80][4e]
You will be able to see 500 meters by[80][23][80][4e]
starlight just as if it was day.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But it won't work in complete[80][23][80][4e]
darkness since there is no light to[80][23][80][4e]
amplify.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Those Night-Vision Goggles will make[80][23][80][4e]
your eyes hurt after a while. Do not use[80][23][80][4e]
them for too long a period of time.[00][ff00]

[af33][8d15][0000]
Thermal Goggles work by thermal[80][23][80][4e]
imaging instead of by amplifying light[80][23][80][4e]
like the Night-Vision Goggles.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They'll work just as well in complete[80][23][80][4e]
darkness. Not only that, they can also[80][23][80][4e]
penetrate optic stealth systems.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
You will be able to spot Claymores too.[00][01ff]

The nuclear weapons disposal facility[80][23][80][4e]
on Shadow Moses Island was built at[80][23][80][4e]
the beginning of this century.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It was made only to temporarily store[80][23][80][4e]
the nuclear warheads.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Why? If they wanted to dispose of[80][23][80][4e]
them, why wouldn't they just dismantle [80][23][80][4e]
them right away?[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0400]
They cannot do that. You see, when[80][23][80][4e]
you dismantle a warhead, you still[80][23][80][4e]
have nuclear materials that must be[80][23][80][4e]
stored.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
At this point, all of the nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
material storage facilities are[80][23][80][4e]
way past capacity.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
But they could not stop dismantling[80][23][80][4e]
weapons while at the same time[80][23][80][4e]
pushing START-2...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]

built so they could temporarily avoid[80][23][80][4e]

Russia and the U.S. reduced their[80][23][80][4e]

the beginning of this century.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

them right away?[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0400]
They cannot do that. You see, when[80][23][80][4e]

[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Yeah, I guess I am. But what about[80][23][80][4e]
the PAL system that the DARPA Chief [80][23][80][4e]
mentioned?[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
It is a device attached to a nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapon system to prevent the missile[80][23][80][4e]
from being armed or launched.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
Usually a secret detonation code or[80][23][80][4e]
combination is necessary to launch[80][23][80][4e]
the missile.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]

code?[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
I do not believe so.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is set up so that the warhead will[80][23][80][4e]
become automatically inactive if any[80][23][80][4e]
attempt is made to remove,[80][23][80][4e]
deactivate or destroy the PAL.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So unless the terrorists either learn[80][23][80][4e]
the detonation codes or get their[80][23][80][4e]
hands on the detonation code[80][23][80][4e]
override keys,[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...there's no way they can launch...[00][01ff]

Just like Baker said, each year there[80][23][80][4e]
are more and more cases of MUF[80][23][80][4e]

them on the black market.[00][0000]

After the fall of the Soviet Union, the[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear management program fell to[80][23][80][4e]
pieces.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In the late 1990's, there were rumors[80][23][80][4e]
that nearly a hundred suitcase-sized[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear bombs mysteriously[80][23][80][4e]
disappeared from the Soviet arsenal.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
We still do not know whether it is true[80][23][80][4e]
or not, but it is possible that they fell[80][23][80][4e]
into the hands of terrorists...[00][0000]

[af33][8d15][0000]
It looks like the DARPA chief and the[80][23][80][4e]
ArmsTech president both agree on[80][23][80][4e]
the concept of maintaining a dominant[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear arsenal.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They are big on the [80][22]nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
deterrent[80][22] theory.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The idea behind a nuclear standoff is[80][23][80][4e]
that both countries would be too[80][23][80][4e]
afraid to use a nuclear weapon for[80][23][80][4e]
fear of a nuclear reprisal.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In other words, the only thing[80][23][80][4e]
preventing a country from totally[80][23][80][4e]
devastating another country with[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear weapons...[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
...is the fear of a nuclear counterstrike.[80][23][80][4e]
Those two probably feel that Metal[80][23][80][4e]
Gear will further promote that security...[00][0000]

[af33][8d15][0000]
The right-wingers believe that as long[80][23][80][4e]
as any country has nuclear weapons,[80][23][80][4e]
they must have them as well.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
That is why they will never be in favor[80][23][80][4e]
of the total elimination of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapons.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
And with each new country that[80][23][80][4e]
acquires nuclear capabilities, the[80][23][80][4e]
need for maintaining that[80][23][80][4e]
counterstrike threat increases.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
As long as the nuclear deterrent[80][23][80][4e]
policy continues, we'll never be rid of[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear weapons...[00][0000]

[af33][8d15][0000]
The theory of nuclear deterrence was[80][23][80][4e]
born during the Cold War, at a time of[80][23][80][4e]
great suspicion between the US and[80][23][80][4e]
the USSR.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The great gulf between the[80][23][80][4e]
ideologies of East and West caused a[80][23][80][4e]
dramatic escalation in the arms race.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
And this escalation of the arms race in[80][23][80][4e]
turn fueled mutual distrust and fear[80][23][80][4e]
between the world's two great[80][23][80][4e]
superpowers.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The last half of the 20th century was[80][23][80][4e]
shaped by the policy of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
deterrence.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But the world has changed.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The Cold War has ended and we are[80][23][80][4e]
now living in a world where small,[80][23][80][4e]
regional conflicts are breaking out[80][23][80][4e]
all over.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Things are not so simple anymore, and[80][23][80][4e]
the policy of nuclear deterrence is[80][23][80][4e]
obsolete.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Most of these regional conflicts are[80][23][80][4e]
the result of age old enmities[80][23][80][4e]
between different ethnic groups[80][23][80][4e]
and religions.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In those cases, the hatred often runs[80][23][80][4e]
so deep that rationality is thrown out[80][23][80][4e]
the window.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
For people such as them, the fear of[80][23][80][4e]
a counterstrike often means little and[80][23][80][4e]
that is why the nuclear deterrence[80][23][80][4e]
policy has lost much of its efficacy.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0400]
A nuclear standoff is not a sufficient[80][23][80][4e]
deterrent in the current world climate.[00][0000]

[af33][8d15][0000]
He became depressed six months[80][23][80][4e]

took his own life.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0800]
He was forced to fight people who[80][23][80][4e]

He couldn't live with the guilt of it...[00][01ff]

Otacon said that now it's possible to[80][23][80][4e]
design and test new types of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapons in a virtual simulation...[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
...without ever exploding a nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
device. Is that true?[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Yes, it is true. Since the establishment[80][23][80][4e]
of DARHT, (the Dual Axis Radiographic[80][23][80][4e]
Hydrodynamic Test Facility),[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
and NIF, (the National Ignition Facility)[80][23][80][4e]
early in the 21st century, there has[80][23][80][4e]
been a wealth of data concerning[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear fission and fusion.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
There is also much data accumulated[80][23][80][4e]
from the nuclear tests conducted over[80][23][80][4e]
the last four decades.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
With the processing speed of today's[80][23][80][4e]
supercomputers, they can design a[80][23][80][4e]
new nuclear weapon through virtual[80][23][80][4e]
reality computer simulations.[00][0000]

[af33][8d15][0000]
In order to collect data for the[80][23][80][4e]
simulation experiments, they are[80][23][80][4e]
doing sub-critical tests underground.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Those are experiments in which they[80][23][80][4e]
detonate high explosives in proximity[80][23][80][4e]
to plutonium without setting off[80][23][80][4e]
a critical chain reaction.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They then measure the effect that[80][23][80][4e]
the shockwave has on the plutonium.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
By measuring the particles which fly[80][23][80][4e]
off the surface of the plutonium, they[80][23][80][4e]
can learn the mass, speed and[80][23][80][4e]
distribution of the plutonium particles.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The politicians insist that whether it is[80][23][80][4e]
above ground or below ground,[80][23][80][4e]
a nuclear test which does not cause a[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear explosion is not a nuclear test[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
...and therefore does not violate[80][23][80][4e]
the CTBT (Comprehensive Nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
Test Ban Treaty).[00][01ff]

[af33][8d15][0000]
The first sub-critical test was[80][23][80][4e]
performed on July 2, 1997 at the[80][23][80][4e]
Nevada Nuclear Testing Facility.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
After that, sub-critical testing became[80][23][80][4e]
extremely common, not only in[80][23][80][4e]
America, but in Russia and other[80][23][80][4e]
countries too.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They say that the reason for the tests[80][23][80][4e]
is to ensure the safety and reliability[80][23][80][4e]
of the existing nuclear stockpile,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
...but that is nothing more than a flimsy[80][23][80][4e]
cover story.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In reality, the danger of a nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapon exploding accidentally[80][23][80][4e]
decreases over time.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is clear that the real reason for[80][23][80][4e]
these tests is to aid in the[80][23][80][4e]
development of new types of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
weapons.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Even the government admits that the[80][23][80][4e]
data collected from those tests is[80][23][80][4e]
used in virtual reality simulation tests.[00][0000]

That is amazing. Dr. Emmerich's father[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]
That was the secret World War II[80][23][80][4e]
project responsible for the creation of[80][23][80][4e]
the first atomic bomb.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It had a huge budget, something like[80][23][80][4e]
two billion dollars. They brought in[80][23][80][4e]
120,000 of the best and brightest[80][23][80][4e]
scientists and engineers to work on it.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
And we all know how that story ended.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In July of 1945, they exploded the first[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear device at Trinity, followed[80][23][80][4e]
shortly after by Hiroshima and[80][23][80][4e]
Nagasaki.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Trinity...the world was changed forever[80][23][80][4e]
that day. Scientists and researchers[80][23][80][4e]
could no longer pretend that their[80][23][80][4e]
hands were clean of blood.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

Manhattan Project, J. Robert[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]
[80][22]The physicists have known sin, and[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]
When Dr. Emmerich designed the[80][23][80][4e]
new Metal Gear prototype, he thought[80][23][80][4e]
he was creating a mobile TMD[80][23][80][4e]
system. He is a very naive man.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
TMD stands for [80][22]Theater Missile[80][23][80][4e]
Defense.[80][22][00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They represent a shift in defense[80][23][80][4e]
priorities from dealing with the threat[80][23][80][4e]
of ICBMs from the former Soviet[80][23][80][4e]
Union,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
...to dealing with small scale regional[80][23][80][4e]
conflicts in the Third World.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Current TMD systems work by a[80][23][80][4e]
combination of THAADs, theater high[80][23][80][4e]
altitude air defense, which intercept[80][23][80][4e]
missiles outside of the atmosphere,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
and Patriot-type missiles which[80][23][80][4e]
intercept missiles within[80][23][80][4e]
the atmosphere.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

America who are opposed to TMD[80][23][80][4e]
systems...[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]

the spirit of the ABM, the Anti-Ballistic[80][23][80][4e]
Missile Treaty.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
And there are also those who say that [80][23][80][4e]
the ABM Treaty is a dinosaur left over[80][23][80][4e]
from the Cold War.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
They argue that the strategy of MAD[80][23][80][4e]
(mutually assured destruction) should[80][23][80][4e]
be maintained by limiting missile[80][23][80][4e]
defense systems.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
There was a big debate over it, but[80][23][80][4e]

expand into new markets,[00][01ff]

[af33][8d15][0000]
There is no doubt about it. After the[80][23][80][4e]
Cold War ended, the chance of a[80][23][80][4e]
full-scale world-wide nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
conflagration was diminished.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But on the other hand, the chances of[80][23][80][4e]
local, tactical use of nuclear weapons[80][23][80][4e]
greatly increased.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Civil wars, revolutions, regional[80][23][80][4e]
disputes...it seems like there is a[80][23][80][4e]
new war popping up somewhere every[80][23][80][4e]
day,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
and many of them are the result of[80][23][80][4e]
centuries-old hatred between[80][23][80][4e]
different ethnic or religious groups.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
These people do not think rationally[80][23][80][4e]
or logically.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In such conflicts, there is no concern[80][23][80][4e]
for the high civilian casualty rate and[80][23][80][4e]
international criticism means little.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
A nuclear deterrent is meaningless[80][23][80][4e]
because emotions run so hot.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Furthermore, unlike strategic nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
missiles, the decision to use tactical[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear missiles is in some cases left[80][23][80][4e]
up to battlefield commanders.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is pretty scary.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0600]
As long as nuclear weapons continue[80][23][80][4e]
to proliferate, the chances that[80][23][80][4e]
someone is going to use them will also[80][23][80][4e]
continue to grow...[00][0000]

[af33][8d15][0000]
Ironically, the policy of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
deterrence has prevented [80][23][80][4e]
the elimination of nuclear weapons.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The entire basis for determining them[80][23][80][4e]
to be illegal has been undermined by[80][23][80][4e]
this military policy.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In other words, nuclear weapons[80][23][80][4e]
cannot be declared illegal because[80][23][80][4e]
we have an entrenched policy which[80][23][80][4e]
makes them legal ipso facto.[00][0000]

America and Russia are not the only[80][23][80][4e]
countries with nuclear weapons.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
During the Cold War, the UK, France[80][23][80][4e]

existence of their own nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
arsenals.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Since we entered the 21st century,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
we have confirmed the existence of[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear weapons programs in[80][23][80][4e]
countries throughout Africa, the[80][23][80][4e]
Middle East, South America and Asia.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Nukes are steadily proliferating. [80][23][80][4e]
The 21st century is paying for the 20th[80][23][80][4e]

the NPT (Non-Proliferation Treaty)[00][01ff]

[af33][8d15][0000]
The IAEA (International Atomic Energy[80][23][80][4e]
Agency) was established in 1957 to[80][23][80][4e]
oversee peaceful as well as military[80][23][80][4e]
applications of atomic power.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But the IAEA can only investigate[80][23][80][4e]
those countries which request an[80][23][80][4e]
investigation.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Furthermore, the timing of the[80][23][80][4e]
inspection must be approved by [80][23][80][4e]
the country in question. They are not[80][23][80][4e]
allowed to do sneak inspections.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The country that is being investigated[80][23][80][4e]
can even dictate the nationality of [80][23][80][4e]
the inspectors that they will allow in.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
In the late 1970's, Iraq would only[80][23][80][4e]
allow inspectors from Bulgaria and[80][23][80][4e]
Russia to enter the country.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The IAEA does not even have the[80][23][80][4e]
authority to level fines against[80][23][80][4e]
countries who have committed[80][23][80][4e]
infractions.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
After the Gulf War, they discovered[80][23][80][4e]
that Iraq had been developing[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear weapons in secret right under[80][23][80][4e]
the investigators' noses![00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0600]
Unfortunately, as an organization, [80][23][80][4e]
the IAEA just did not have the teeth to[80][23][80][4e]
effectively stop the proliferation of[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear weapons and technology.[00][0000]

In 1970, all five nuclear powers,[80][23][80][4e]
America, the Soviet Union, France,[80][23][80][4e]
England and China, signed the NPT.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The treaty provided that the[80][23][80][4e]
non-nuclear equipped countries could[80][23][80][4e]
receive assistance for peaceful[80][23][80][4e]
applications of nuclear power.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But military applications of nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
power were strictly prohibited,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
and the IAEA was given the[80][23][80][4e]
responsibility of investigating[80][23][80][4e]
countries who were suspected of[80][23][80][4e]
being in non-compliance with the NPT.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But the IAEA could not stop the[80][23][80][4e]
proliferation of nuclear weapons either.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Not only could not the IAEA levy any[80][23][80][4e]
penalties against violating nations, but[80][23][80][4e]
it became impossible to distinguish[80][23][80][4e]
between...[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
...technologies which would lead to[80][23][80][4e]
military development and[80][23][80][4e]

civilian applications.[00][0000]

That stuff that is flowing in those[80][23][80][4e]
ditches on the 1st floor must be[80][23][80][4e]
radioactive nuclear waste water.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
You had better stay away from it. You[80][23][80][4e]
are already exposed enough just by[80][23][80][4e]
being in that area. Any further[80][23][80][4e]
exposure could be fatal.[00][01ff]

Anytime fuel is burned in a nuclear[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]
some spent-fuel mixed with highly[80][23][80][4e]

Spent nuclear fuel stays radioactive[80][23][80][4e]

There was a time when we thought it[80][23][80][4e]
was safe to seal the nuclear waste in[80][23][80][4e]
special containers...[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
and bury it in a layer of rock salt[80][23][80][4e]
without much exposure to[80][23][80][4e]
underground water.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Even though we now know there are[80][23][80][4e]
big problems with that, we still do not[80][23][80][4e]
have an effective disposal solution.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0600]
Most of the nuclear waste we produce[80][23][80][4e]
is just shoved underground with no[80][23][80][4e]
intention of ever processing it.[00][01ff]

[af33][8d15][0000]
There is a process which involves[80][23][80][4e]
mixing the nuclear waste with low[80][23][80][4e]
grade uranium to convert it into a[80][23][80][4e]
mixed oxide (MOX) fuel...[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
...for burning in light water reactors,[80][23][80][4e]
usually in the form of glass logs.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But MOX contaminates a nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
reactor more quickly than low grade[80][23][80][4e]
uranium. It is also highly toxic.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It is economically unfeasible unless[80][23][80][4e]
the price of uranium is more than four[80][23][80][4e]
times what it currently is.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Not only that, you cannot ignore the[80][23][80][4e]
danger inherent in transporting the[80][23][80][4e]
MOX from the processing factories to[80][23][80][4e]
the nuclear reactors.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
An accident could lead to radioactive[80][23][80][4e]
contamination or the materials could[80][23][80][4e]
be hijacked by terrorists...[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
No, I do not think MOX could be[80][23][80][4e]
called a viable solution to the problem[80][23][80][4e]

There is only one effective use for[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear waste.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0400]
Military applications. You see, after[80][23][80][4e]
chemical reprocessing, they can[80][23][80][4e]
separate plutonium from the nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
waste.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
Nuclear weapons normally use military[80][23][80][4e]
grade plutonium 239 with a purity of[80][23][80][4e]
93-94%.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
It is made in special nuclear reactors[80][23][80][4e]
designed for military applications.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
On the other hand, the plutonium in[80][23][80][4e]
spent nuclear fuel only has a purity of[80][23][80][4e]
about 60%.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
But that does not mean that spent[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear fuel cannot be used for[80][23][80][4e]
military applications.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
America has been successful in tests[80][23][80][4e]
using weapons made from nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
reactor grade plutonium.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
That means that eventually everyone[80][23][80][4e]
will be able to make nuclear weapons[80][23][80][4e]
from plutonium separated from spent[80][23][80][4e]
nuclear fuel.[00][0000]

Spent nuclear fuel can also be used[80][23][80][4e]
to make depleted uranium (DU)[80][23][80][4e]
bullets or shells. They are armor-[80][23][80][4e]
piercing anti-tank rounds.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
DU is two-and-a-half times denser[80][23][80][4e]
than steel and 50% denser than lead,[80][23][80][4e]
so it makes it an extremely effective[80][23][80][4e]
armor-piercing weapon.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
It can cut through tank armor like[80][23][80][4e]
a hot knife through butter.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Unfortunately, when a DU round[80][23][80][4e]
explodes, it spreads a fine dust which,[80][23][80][4e]
when absorbed into a body,[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
supposedly causes terrible long-term[80][23][80][4e]
health problems including genetic[80][23][80][4e]
damage.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0400]
During the Gulf War, American as well[80][23][80][4e]
as Iraqi soldiers were exposed to DU[80][23][80][4e]
dust and suffered from radiation[80][23][80][4e]
poisoning and other illnesses.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
The American government conducted[80][23][80][4e]
research to discover whether[80][23][80][4e]
exposure could lead to cancer or[80][23][80][4e]
genetic damage,[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
...but the results were inconclusive.[00][01ff]
[af33][c340][0000]
Some people think that this type of[80][23][80][4e]
radioactive contamination is what is[80][23][80][4e]
behind the [80][22]Gulf War Syndrome[80][22],[00][01ff]

Snake, that is a nuclear warhead[80][23][80][4e]
storage area.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Are all these filled with nuclear[80][23][80][4e]
warheads?[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Yes. But their detonation mechanisms[80][23][80][4e]
have been removed.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
So I don't have to worry about this[80][23][80][4e]
island turning into a pile of smoking[80][23][80][4e]
rubble?[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
No. But if the casing is damaged, [80][23][80][4e]
they may be leaking nuclear materials.[80][23][80][4e]
Please make sure you do not use[80][23][80][4e]
your gun around there.[00][0000]

Naturally, nuclear weapons contain[80][23][80][4e]
plutonium.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Most of the radiation emitted by[80][23][80][4e]
plutonium isotopes consists of[80][23][80][4e]
alpha rays.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The ionization effects are strong, but[80][23][80][4e]
if they are kept in containers there is[80][23][80][4e]
no danger of exposure.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
But if plutonium enters the body[80][23][80][4e]
through breathing or other contact, [80][23][80][4e]
it is quickly absorbed into the bones[80][23][80][4e]
and internal organs.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
After that, there is no way to remove it.[80][23][80][4e]
[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
Once that happens, the victim will be[80][23][80][4e]
constantly exposed to it, and just one[80][23][80][4e]
one-millionth of a gram of plutonium[80][23][80][4e]
can cause cancer.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
That is why a plutonium leak is such a[80][23][80][4e]
serious danger. Make sure you do not[80][23][80][4e]
use your gun anywhere near there.[00][0000]

The plutonium version of[80][23][80][4e]
bio-remediation, huh.[00][01ff]
[ca21][3bf7][0000]
Instead of processing, what about[80][23][80][4e]
reusing it? I thought that they were[80][23][80][4e]
working on using dismantled[80][23][80][4e]
plutonium for civilian applications.[00][01ff]

[af33][8d15][0000]
It is easy to plant the mines, you see,[80][23][80][4e]

[af33][8d15][0000]
It requires more time and manpower[80][23][80][4e]
than anyone is willing to invest.[00][01ff]
[af33][8d15][0000]
The superpowers need to donate[80][23][80][4e]
more mine detectors and other[80][23][80][4e]
